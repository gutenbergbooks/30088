<h2>DOROTHY DAINTY AT THE MOUNTAINS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>AT THE CLEVERTON</h3>

<div class='cap'>THE great hotel on the crest of the hill
was bathed in sunlight that poured
from a rift in the clouds, as if sent for the
sole purpose of showing the grand portico,
the broad piazza, and the flag that floated
gracefully on the summer breeze.</div>

<p>Its many windows seemed to be looking
across the valley to opposite mountain
peaks, and one could easily imagine that
its wide, open doorway, smiled genially as
if offering a welcome to all arriving guests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Two little girls ran across the lawn, the
one with flaxen curls, the other with sunny
brown ringlets.</p>

<p>The fair-haired little girl had eyes as blue
as the blue blossoms that she held in her
hand, while her playmate's eyes were soft
and brown, and told that her heart was loving
and true.</p>

<p>The little blue-eyed girl was Dorothy
Dainty, and the child who clasped her hand
was her dearest friend, Nancy Ferris.</p>

<p>Nancy had no parents, and a few years
before Dorothy's mamma had taken her
under her care and protection, and she was
being trained and educated as carefully as
was Dorothy, the little daughter of the
house.</p>

<p>They had come to the Hotel Cleverton
to spend the summer, and the first few days
of their stay, they had explored all the land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that lay immediately around the hotel, and
had found many beautiful spots, but one
thing held their interest,&mdash;they loved the
echo, and never tired of awakening it.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Dorothy. "Run with
me over to the white birches, and we'll
shout, and listen!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty had told them the story of
Echo, the nymph, who for loving Pan and
following him and calling to him had been
changed into a huge rock on the mountainside,
and forever compelled to mock each
voice she heard.</p>

<p>The old legend of the nymph had caught
their fancy, and often they paused in their
play to shout, and listen to what seemed to
them the voice of some fairy of the mountains.</p>

<p>Now they stood beside the birches,
Dorothy with one arm around a white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
trunk, and Nancy near her. At their feet
were countless bluebells, overhead the
blue sky, while across and beyond the valley
rose the mountain capped by white
clouds that looked as soft as swan's-down.</p>

<p>"Here! Here!" cried Dorothy, and echo
answered, "Here,&mdash;ere!"</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Dorothy, clasping her
hands, and laughing with delight. "It answers
as if it was a truly voice that heard
and replied.</p>

<p>"Nancy, I love you!" she cried, and
again they plainly heard:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Love you-oo!"</p>

<p>They thought it great fun to shout and
call, and hear their cries so cleverly repeated.</p>

<p>And now another child ran out from the
great doorway, paused a moment as if looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
for some one, then, seeing the two little
figures near the clump of birches, stole
softly near them.</p>

<p>On tiptoe, and with tread as soft and
noiseless as a cat, she made her way over
the short grass, until she was quite near
them. Then, hiding behind a low bush, she
watched them. How still she stood! For
what was she waiting? Her bold eyes were
full of mischief, as she whispered, "Oh,
hurry <i>up!</i>"</p>

<p>Dorothy Dainty put her hands to her
mouth, trumpet fashion, and called:</p>

<p>"Come and catch us!" and instantly the
echo from the distant mountain and a shrill
voice behind them, repeated:</p>

<p>"Come and catch us!"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh-o!" cried Dorothy, and Nancy
ran to her, and threw her arms about
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ought not to frighten Dorothy like
that!" cried Nancy.</p>

<p>A saucy laugh answered her.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't nice to be shrieked at, and
you do it just like the echo, you know you
do, and it's enough to frighten any one,"
said Nancy.</p>

<p>The little tease was not in the least
abashed. She could imitate almost any
sound that she had ever heard, and each
success made her eager to repeat her efforts
at mocking.</p>

<p>"I made old Mrs. Hermanton fly up out
of her chair, and drop her ball of worsted
and knitting-needles, when I shouted close
to her ear."</p>

<p>"Why, Floretta!" cried Nancy.</p>

<p>Now you think that was horrid, but <i>I</i>
tell you it was funny. She'd just been telling
about her darling little lap-dog that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
died <i>ten years ago</i>, and she got out her
handkerchief to cry, and put it up to her
eyes.</p>

<p>"'Oh, if I only could hear his lovely bark
again!' she said, and right behind her chair,
I said:</p>

<p>"'Ki-yi! Yip! Yip!' and she jumped up
much as a foot from her seat."</p>

<p>Nancy laughed. How could she help it?
The old lady had told every man, woman,
and child who sat upon the piazza, how
much she had suffered in the loss of the
dog.</p>

<p>One testy old gentleman who was
troubled with gout, spoke rather plainly.
"Madam," he said, "I've heard that story
every day of this week, and all I can say is,
I wish you had gout in your feet as I have,
and you'd have no time to waste crying for
a puppy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>He certainly was hopelessly rude, but one
must admit every day is far too often to be
forced to listen to an uninteresting tale.</p>

<p>Floretta stood looking down at the toe of
her shoe. She moved it from side to side
along the grass for a moment, then she
spoke again.</p>

<p>"You know old Mr. Cunningham has
gout, and is awful cross?"</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy nodded. They did
indeed know that.</p>

<p>"Well, he sat on the piazza and laughed
when I scared Mrs. Hermanton, so I want
to know if he'll think it's funny <i>every</i> time
I do things. You know he puts one foot up
on a chair, and every time any one touches
that chair ever so little, he cries: '<i>Oh</i>, oh,
oh!' and holds on to his foot.</p>

<p>"The next time I'm near him, I'm going
to make b'lieve hit my foot against something,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and then I'll cry out, just 'zactly as
he does:</p>

<p>"'<i>Oh</i>, oh, oh!' and I'll hold on to my
foot," said Floretta.</p>

<p>"I know it's funny," said Dorothy, "but
I don't think you ought to."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> needn't. P'raps you couldn't
do it just like other folks, but I <i>can</i>, and
I'm going to!" said Floretta.</p>

<p>She was a handsome child, but her boldness
marred her beauty.</p>

<p>She was, indeed, a clever imitator, but
she had been told so too often. Her mother
constantly praised her cleverness, and unwise
friends applauded her efforts, until
Floretta acquired the idea that she must, on
all occasions, mimic some one.</p>

<p>Sometimes those whom she mocked
thought it clever, and laughed when they
had thus been held up to derision.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>At other times Floretta found that she
had chosen the wrong person to mimic, and
had received a sharp rebuke.</p>

<p>This taught her nothing, however.</p>

<p>She thought any one who did not enjoy
her antics must be very ill-natured, while
her silly mother considered that Floretta
had been abused.</p>

<p>While Dorothy and Nancy were talking
with Floretta, they were picking large
bouquets of bluebells and a tiny white
flower that grew as abundantly as the bluebells,
and blossomed as freely.</p>

<p>It pleased her, for the moment, to gather
some of the blossoms, and soon the three
were too busy to talk, each trying to
see which could gather the largest bouquet.</p>

<p>On the hotel piazza Mrs. Paxton sat, occupied
with her embroidery, but not too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
busy to talk. She was <i>never</i> too busy
to talk, if she could find any one to
listen.</p>

<p>Near her sat two ladies who had just arrived,
and old Mr. Cunningham, who
frowned darkly at the magazine that he
was trying to read.</p>

<p>It was not that the story displeased him
that he frowned, but that he was bored with
hearing what Mrs. Paxton was saying,
mainly because she always said the same
thing.</p>

<p>"You see, with our wealth and position,
it is impossible that little Floretta should
ever make any use of her talents for any
purpose other than the amusement of her
friends," she said.</p>

<p>One of the two ladies, whose fine face and
sweet low voice bespoke refinement, looked
fixedly at Mrs. Paxton, and wondered that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
any woman should be willing to boast so
foolishly.</p>

<p>The other, whose garments told of a great
love of display, seemed interested, and even
impressed.</p>

<p>"What is her especial talent?" she
asked, "I really should like to know. Is
she musical?"</p>

<p>"O dear, yes," Mrs. Paxton hastened to
reply; "she plays delightfully, and she
has a voice that is really quite unusual for a
child; she dances, too, but her greatest gift
is her power of imitation. She has a sensitive
nature that is open to impressions, and
she sees the funny side of everything. She
really is a wonderful little mimic. You
must see her to appreciate her charm."</p>

<p>The quiet woman looked as if she thought
this a doubtful accomplishment, but the one
who had eagerly listened said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she? I should be <i>so</i> pleased
to see her. Not all children are so interesting.
Many are dull."</p>

<p>"And lucky they are!" growled old Mr.
Cunningham, under his breath, but the
ladies did not hear that.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I don't want these flowers now I've
picked them," cried Floretta. "You can
have them if you want them," she said, as
she turned toward Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I can't hold any more than I have,"
said Dorothy, "but you could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then here they go!" cried Floretta, as
she flung them broadcast, to lie and wilt in
the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was too bad to throw them
away," said Dorothy. "I was going to say,
if you didn't care for them, perhaps Mrs.
Hermanton might like them. She said she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
liked wild flowers and used to pick them,
but her rheumatism won't let her pick them
now."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I wouldn't have bothered to
take them back to her," Floretta replied;
and turning about, she ran back to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"Come here, Floretta!" said Mrs. Paxton.
"This lady wishes to see you."</p>

<p>Usually Floretta when asked to do anything,
preferred to do something else.</p>

<p>This time, thinking that she saw an opportunity
for a lark, she went promptly and
paused beside her mother's chair.</p>

<p>"This is Mrs. Dayne, Floretta. Mrs.
Dayne, this is my little daughter."</p>

<p>Floretta looked up and smiled, but said
nothing. She had never been taught that
she must reply courteously when spoken to.</p>

<p>Her pretty face pleased Mrs. Dayne, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was much the same sort of woman that Mrs.
Paxton was. She wished that Floretta
could be induced to perform.</p>

<p><i>Induced!</i> She was already wondering if
she would have a chance to show off.</p>

<p>The opportunity came soon, and she was
delighted.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham had become drowsy,
and his magazine dropped to the piazza
floor.</p>

<p>In stooping to recover it, he hurt his
gouty foot, and cried out.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>, oh-o!" he cried, and like an echo,
"<i>Oh</i>, oh-o!" cried Floretta, catching hold
of her own foot and hopping wildly
about.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Paxton laughed gaily, as
if Floretta had done a very smart thing,
while Mrs. Dayne, who was as silly a
woman as Mrs. Paxton, joined in the merriment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
thus hoping to gain favor with her
new friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Cunningham, without a word, took
his magazine and, limping painfully, left
the piazza, and went indoors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinton, an odd expression on her
fine face, took her parasol from the chair
where it lay, and went for a walk down the
path toward the birches. She was disgusted
with Mrs. Paxton, Floretta, and
Mrs. Dayne, although she felt that the little
girl was least of all at fault.</p>

<p>She was only an untaught, untrained
child, to be pitied rather than blamed. She
knew that they would think her very unkind
if she did not seem to approve of
Floretta, and she could not laugh at cruelty.</p>

<p>The child was indeed a clever imitator,
but the fact remained that it <i>was</i> cruel to
mock an outcry caused by pain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy were coming toward
her, on their way toward the hotel, their
hands filled with blossoms, faces bright and
smiling.</p>

<p>They greeted her gaily, and Dorothy offered
her some of the flowers.</p>

<p>"I'll give half to you, and half to
mamma," said Dorothy. "I mean, I will if
you'd like to have them."</p>

<p>"It is a sweet gift, and I shall enjoy
them in my room," Mrs. Vinton said. "I
have a lovely vase that is worthy to hold
such beautiful blossoms."</p>

<p>"I'll divide mine between Aunt Charlotte
and Mrs. Hermanton," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"You both like to give," said Mrs. Vinton.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" they cried together, and as
she left them, Dorothy said:</p>

<p>"Isn't she a sweet, lovely lady?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and I like to hear her talk, her
voice always sounds so pleasant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinton, as she walked along the
little path, her flowers in her hand, thought
of Dorothy and Nancy.</p>

<p>"They are two dear little girls," she
said, "and add to the charm of this lovely
place."</p>

<p>"Would you dare to give Mr. Cunningham
some bluebells for his buttonhole?"
said Nancy. "I'd like to, but <i>I</i> wouldn't
dare."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Dorothy said. "I'd
like to, too, and he 'most always has a rosebud,
but sometimes he doesn't. When we
get back, if he's on the piazza, and hasn't
a bud in his buttonhole, I'll try to dare to
offer him some of these blossoms."</p>

<p>Dear little Dorothy! She wondered if
she would be rewarded with a frown!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Floretta and her mother were not there,
neither was Mrs. Dayne, but in a shady corner
sat Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>Nancy ran in to take her flowers to Aunt
Charlotte and Mrs. Hermanton.</p>

<p>Dorothy hesitated. She would have been
even more timid, had she known how recently
he had been offended.</p>

<p>He looked up from his book, frowned,
then smiled and nodded pleasantly.</p>

<p>He had thought that Floretta had returned,
and was pleasantly surprised to see
Dorothy, instead.</p>

<p>Softly she crossed the piazza until she
stood beside him.</p>

<p>"May I give you a few of these bluebells
for your buttonhole?" she said. "They're
only wild flowers, but they're pretty ones,"
she added, fearing that, after all, he might
not care for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, thank you, my dear. I surely
would like them, especially as they are offered
me by a real little lady."</p>

<p>He placed the cluster that she offered
him in his lapel, as he spoke, and looked to
Dorothy for approval.</p>

<p>"They are wild flowers, truly," he said,
"but I think they are quite as attractive
as the buds I have been wearing," and
Dorothy was glad that she had offered
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE</h3>

<div class='cap'>THREE weeks had passed, and as nearly
every day had been fair, the guests at
the Cleverton had lived out of doors, appearing
at the hotel at meal-time, and at
night.</div>

<p>Other wild flowers beside the bluebells
were blossoming gaily, peeping up from the
grass as if offering a welcome to all who
looked at them; and even great rocks and
ledges held tiny blossoming plants in their
crevices.</p>

<p>The pony, Romeo, had come to the mountains
with the family, and seemed to enjoy
the outing.</p>

<p>Every morning Dorothy and Nancy went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for a drive, and Romeo tossed his mane, and
pranced as if to show his delight.</p>

<p>One morning the pony was standing at
the porch, waiting for his little mistress,
who soon came running down the stairs.</p>

<p>Floretta was standing in the hall, spinning
a top.</p>

<p>A sign on the wall plainly stated that
children must not play in the hall, but that
did not disturb Floretta.</p>

<p>Deftly she wound the string, and the
great top fell to the floor, where it hummed
and spun as rapidly as if a boy's hand had
flung it.</p>

<p>She picked it up, and again wound it, this
time throwing it with even greater force.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" she cried. "I b'lieve
it spins faster every time I throw it!"</p>

<p>Dorothy looked over the baluster at the
humming top, but said nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew that Floretta had seen the notice;
indeed a number of the children had
stood in the hall when it had been tacked
up.</p>

<p>Looking up at Dorothy, Floretta noticed
the whip in her hand.</p>

<p>"Riding?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, for a little while," said Dorothy.
"It's a lovely morning, and I mean to see
how quickly Romeo will take me to the
'Spring.'"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to ride horseback,"
said Floretta, rudely.</p>

<p>"You won't care to spin tops in this hall
if Matson catches you," cried a shrill voice,
from an upper hall.</p>

<p>"Pooh! I'm not afraid of Matson,"
Floretta said, boldly, looking up at the boy
who had tried to frighten her.</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't you?" said the boy in a teasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
voice. "Well, he manages this hotel,
and he'll <i>make</i> you stop if he catches
you!"</p>

<p>"You stop, Jack Tiverton!" cried
Floretta.</p>

<p>"You'll be the one to stop!" said Jack,
with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>Dorothy crossed the hall, stepping
around Floretta, who stood exactly in the
way.</p>

<p>Looking back, she saw Floretta show the
tip of her tongue to Jack, while Jack, not
to be outdone, made a most outrageous
face.</p>

<p>"I wish they weren't so horrid!"
Dorothy said to herself, as she left the hall.</p>

<p>Having mounted Romeo, with the
groom's aid, she rode off down the lovely,
shady road, the man on his horse, following
at a respectful distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>She touched the pony lightly with her
whip, and he responded by breaking into a
gentle gallop.</p>

<p>Dorothy's bright curls flew back from
her flushed face, and she laughed as she flew
over the road.</p>

<p>The groom watched her admiringly, and
marvelled that so small a girl could be such
a perfect little equestrienne.</p>

<p>The ride had brightened her eyes, and she
always looked smaller than she really was
when mounted upon Romeo.</p>

<p>He was a handsome animal, with flowing
mane and tail, and the groom spoke truthfully
when he muttered:</p>

<p>"Them two makes a high-bred pair.
Miss Dorothy is a girl 'ristycrat, an' the
little hoss is a hoss 'ristycrat, if ever there
was one."</p>

<p>The groom had been in the service of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Dainty family but a few months, but in that
time he had become devoted to the little
daughter of the house. All the servants
loved Dorothy, and were almost as fond of
Nancy Ferris.</p>

<p>The young groom had heard Nancy's
story, and he felt a deep interest in the
little girl, who once had been a waif.</p>

<p>Now, his pleasant face wore a smile as he
followed Dorothy, and saw how firmly the
little figure stuck to the saddle, and rode
as if girl and pony were one and inseparable.</p>

<p>They reached the "Spring," a spot
whose beauty drew all travellers to it, and
artists lingered there to paint, and thus
perpetuate its charm.</p>

<p>Romeo looked down at the clear stream
that reflected his figure so perfectly.</p>

<p>"He wants a drink," said Dorothy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
"lead him to a good place, Thomas,
please."</p>

<p>He helped her to dismount, and then led
the pony to a shady spot where he could
drink, and enjoy the cool, clear water.</p>

<p>Dorothy at once commenced to gather
some of the lovely wild flowers that grew
near the water's edge, but farther up the
stream.</p>

<p>"These are different from any that I've
ever found here," she thought.</p>

<p>Her hands were nearly filled with the
lovely blossoms, and she was reaching out
to grasp an especially pretty one, when a
strangely familiar voice, just behind her,
said:</p>

<p>"I think I see some one I've <i>often</i> seen
before!"</p>

<p>Dorothy turned, and a little cry of surprise
and pleasure escaped her lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>There were Mrs. Barnet and dear little
Flossie coming toward her, while very
near her was the owner of the voice,
Flossie's handsome, merry-hearted Uncle
Harry! Just behind him was his lovely
young wife, and the baby in charge of a
maid.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> glad, <i>so</i> glad to see you!"
cried Dorothy. "And Flossie Barnet, did
you know you were coming up here, when
I said 'good-by' to you and Molly Merton
at Merrivale?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know <i>surely</i>, but I <i>almost</i>
knew," Flossie admitted, "but Uncle
Harry said, 'Don't tell 'til you <i>know</i>,' and
I didn't <i>truly</i> know until after you were
gone."</p>

<p>"Well, it's fine to have you here," said
Dorothy, "but I do truly b'lieve it's almost
nicer to be surprised, and have you;" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
she threw her arm around Flossie, as she
walked beside her.</p>

<p>Tall, handsome Uncle Harry thought he
saw a chance for a bit of a joke.</p>

<p>"I wonder why some one isn't surprised
to see <i>me?</i>" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am," said Dorothy, "and glad,
too."</p>

<p>"Well, thank you," said Uncle Harry;
then with a face that he tried to make sad,
he said:</p>

<p>"But I know you aren't as glad as you
were to see Flossie, because,&mdash;you didn't
put your arm around <i>my</i> waist!"</p>

<p>He had tried to look very glum, but his
blue eyes were laughing.</p>

<p>Big, handsome Uncle Harry could not
look woebegone, and the two little girls
laughed at his attempt.</p>

<p>"The barge is taking our party over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the 'Cleverton,' and I see you have the
pony, Dorothy," said Uncle Harry. "Will
you run a race with the barge?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes!" cried Dorothy, "and
Romeo will come in ahead!"</p>

<p>"If he does," said Uncle Harry, "I'll
surely decorate him with a blue ribbon!"</p>

<p>With many a laugh and jest, and much
guessing as to which would be the winner,
the merry party clambered into the barge;
Dorothy mounted Romeo, and they were
off over the road, on the way to the
hotel.</p>

<p>The horses, like the average barge horses,
were not beauties, but they saw the pony
rush forward, and they made an effort at
speed. They plunged forward, at what, to
them, seemed a reckless pace, but the fine,
handsome Romeo shot past them, his nostrils<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dilated, and his eyes bright with excitement.
Dorothy's gay laugh rang out as
she passed them, and Uncle Harry, as he
looked after the flying figure, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The little fairy! I believe no other
child could ride so fearlessly as that!"</p>

<p>Often she looked back, as she sped over
the road. Try as they would, the old horses
could not overtake her.</p>

<p>As soon as the barge appeared in sight
between the trees, she touched Romeo
lightly with her whip-stock, and then she
laughed gaily as he plunged forward, the
old barge rattling along far behind.</p>

<p>She did not permit Romeo to again
slacken his pace, and thus arrived at the
Cleverton before the barge was in sight, so
slow had been its progress.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy!" she cried, "Who <i>do</i> you
think has come?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="397" height="500" alt="Often she looked back, as she sped over the road.&mdash;Page 31." title="" />
<span class="caption">Often she looked back, as she sped over the road.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_31">Page 31.</a></i></span>
</div>

<p>"Who has come?" Nancy asked.
"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"I mean you can't guess who is coming,
and there they come now, Nancy, just
look!"</p>

<p>Nancy did look, saw the barge swinging
around the curve of the road, saw a
tiny handkerchief waving, and then a
sweet little face looked out to smile at
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Flossie Barnet!" cried Nancy,
joyfully, "and her mamma, and,&mdash;why, yes
it <i>is!</i> It's Flossie's Uncle Harry!"</p>

<p>He heard the cry, and heard the welcome
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Flossie's Uncle Harry, and all
the other little girls' Uncle Harry who care
to claim him for an uncle," he said, with a
laugh, as he lifted his little niece down from
the barge.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad he came, too," said
Dorothy, upon hearing which, he turned
and lifting his hat, bowed, thus acknowledging
the compliment that she had paid
him. His eyes twinkled with pleasure, for
he loved children, and he valued their regard.
He was a big, manly fellow, with a
warm heart, as loving, and as merry as that
of a child.</p>

<p>The Barnet party added much to the
pleasure of little events and entertainments
at the Hotel Cleverton. Flossie became, at
once, a favorite with the other children,
and her charming mother was deservedly
popular with all.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry, who possessed a fine voice,
willingly sang whenever a musical program
was arranged for an evening, while his
lovely young wife, who was an accomplished
pianist, played his accompaniments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
or rendered solos, thus generously
adding to the pleasure of the other guests.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I tell you what it is," said old Mr. Cunningham,
"that big bank of clouds hanging
over that mountain means rain, and plenty
of it, I believe."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," said Uncle
Harry, "and if we <i>do</i> have a three days'
rain, as we sometimes do, we shall have to
use every effort to keep things humming,
and so forget the storm."</p>

<p>They had been sitting on the piazza, and
talking of the days of uninterrupted sunshine
that they had enjoyed, when, in a few
minutes, the blue sky had been hidden, as
if by a thin, pearly veil, while hanging over
the mountain was the mass of leaden clouds
that had seemed to prophesy rain.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> don't want it to rain," wailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Floretta, who stood near them, her pretty
face puckered into a most unpleasant
frown.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the weather can't be arranged
especially for you," said Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>He, like all the guests, was very tired of
the child who was either whining, or boisterously,
rudely gay. Just at this point,
Mrs. Paxton came out on the piazza, a small
note-book and pencil in her hand.</p>

<p>She hastened toward the two gentlemen,
and smiled as if she were conferring a
favor.</p>

<p>"With the chance of a stormy evening,
we are trying to arrange a program that
will give us a pleasant evening indoors,"
she said. "I am sure you will help
me."</p>

<p>She had smiled at both, and old Mr. Cunningham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
who heartily disliked her, was
only too glad to reply.</p>

<p>"I'm not musical, madam," he said,
"but I'll whistle 'Hail Columbia' for you,
if you will promise not to reprimand me if
I get off the key."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" she cried. "You are always
so amusing. One never knows if you
are joking, or serious."</p>

<p>"It would be very serious, and no joke,
I assure you, if you were actually obliged
to listen to my whistling," was the curt
reply, and he turned once more to scan the
sky and the distant mountains.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry, of course, agreed to sing,
his wife promised to play, and Mrs. Paxton
moved toward where Mrs. Dainty and her
companion, Aunt Charlotte, were sitting,
with Dorothy and Nancy near them.</p>

<p>"Will your little daughter sing for us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
this evening?" she asked. "We are eager
to have quite a fine program."</p>

<p>"Dorothy shall sing for you, surely,"
Mrs. Dainty said, "and Nancy, I am sure,
will give a little solo."</p>

<p>"Oh, does Nancy sing or play?" Mrs.
Paxton asked, in surprise, for thus far
Nancy had not exhibited her talent, whatever
it might be.</p>

<p>"She will give you a solo that shall be
neither singing nor playing," Mrs. Dainty
replied, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"How very interesting!" said Mrs. Paxton.
She had invited Dorothy to sing because
other guests had expressed the wish
to hear her.</p>

<p>Here was a <i>second</i> child with talent of
<i>some</i> kind! Well, Floretta's imitations of
other people would certainly eclipse the efforts
of the other little girls! Mrs. Paxton's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sole idea in arranging the entertainment
was for the purpose of showing Floretta's
mimicry.</p>

<p>A small figure paused a moment in the
doorway, then stepped back, and peeped
out, scanning the groups upon the piazza.</p>

<p>"She isn't there!" he whispered. "She's
backed out, an' she <i>said</i> she'd do
it!"</p>

<p>He drew back into the shadow, and
waited, hoping that when he looked again
he might see her.</p>

<p>A second peep at the guests on the piazza
showed that Floretta was not among them.</p>

<p>"She didn't <i>try</i> to do it!" he muttered.</p>

<p>He held something in his hand, which he
kept behind his back.</p>

<p>He was about to peep again when a light
hand touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>He turned, and there stood Floretta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
looking prettier than usual in her short
white frock, white shoes, and pink hair
ribbons.</p>

<p>"Did you get one?" whispered Jack.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Floretta, and from behind
her back she produced a long corn-cob. "I
took mine from the table at noon, when ma
wasn't looking, and ran from the dining-room,
and hid it in our room," said Floretta.
"How did you get yours?"</p>

<p>"I asked the head waiter to get mine for
me," said Jack, "and he acted as if he
thought me a ninny. He gave it to me all
the same, and asked what I was up to. I
didn't tell him, though."</p>

<p>They giggled softly.</p>

<p>"Ready?" whispered Jack, softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Floretta, and then,
with corn-cobs held to their mouths, and
their fingers working as if playing upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
flutes, they marched out on to the piazza,
loudly singing, "Hail Columbia."</p>

<p>Some of the guests laughed, none so
loudly as Mrs. Paxton, who declared that
it taxed her intellect to imagine what put
such outrageously funny notions into children's
heads.</p>

<p>"I can answer that, madam, and without
trying very hard, either. It's Satan,
madam, Satan, who from watching their
actions, takes them to be his near relatives,"
said Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little procession of two,
encouraged by the laughter, marched in and
out between the groups of guests, until unlucky
Floretta let her corn-cob slip from
her fingers, the moist, sticky thing falling
upon the light silk skirt of a lady who sat
near Mrs. Paxton.</p>

<p>"There, there, Floretta, never mind,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
said Mrs. Paxton; then turning to the
wearer of the gown, she said, "I don't
think it will stain it in the least. Children
will be children, and must have their fun!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>AN ENTERTAINMENT</h3>

<div class='cap'>MRS. PAXTON had laughed at what
she chose to call the "funny" antics
of Floretta and Jack, but in truth, she
had been very angry.</div>

<p>She swept from the piazza, Floretta,
firmly grasped, walking beside her. Jack
Tiverton's mother took him to her room,
where she could talk to him, without fear
of interruption.</p>

<p>Floretta sat on a low divan, sullen and
obstinate.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes she had listened,
while her mother had told what a disrespectful
thing she had done.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it was not respectful,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
grumbled Floretta, "we were just having
a little fun."</p>

<p>"And it was fun at my expense," said
Mrs. Paxton. "I was annoyed, just when
I was making plans for a <i>fine</i> entertainment,
to have you and that boy parade out
on to the piazza with those old corn-cobs,
singing, or rather <i>howling</i>, like young savages!"</p>

<p>This, and much more Floretta was forced
to listen to, but during the remainder of
the scolding, she did not speak, or reply in
any way.</p>

<p>She was still very sullen when her mother
left the room, and no one saw her until she
appeared in the dining-room at dinner.</p>

<p>She tasted one dish after another, but
managed to eat but little dinner. She
wished her mother to think that the scolding
had made her ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It proved to be wasted effort. Mrs. Paxton
had been so interested in what Mrs.
Dayne was saying that she had not noticed
that Floretta let the various courses go untasted.</p>

<p>She had hoped to worry her mother, but
had only punished herself!</p>

<p>She was very hungry when they left the
table, and also very angry.</p>

<p>"I might just as well have eaten my dinner,"
she muttered, "she never noticed
that I didn't."</p>

<p>When the hour arrived that had been set
for the concert, every guest was present,
and all were talking and laughing gaily,
and very glad that an evening's amusement
had been provided.</p>

<p>Outside, the rain was descending in torrents,
while a cold wind whistled around
the corners, as if demanding admittance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Indoors the heavy red hangings were
drawn over the lace draperies, great logs
blazed in the fireplaces, while over all
softly shaded lights gave an air of cozy
comfort that made one feel sheltered and
safe from the storm.</p>

<p>A group of ladies sat chatting together,
and one, a recent arrival, was saying that
she had understood that children were not
permitted as guests at the Cleverton.</p>

<p>"There are only a few children here,"
Mrs. Vinton said, "and some of them are
charming."</p>

<p>"While others are <i>not?</i>" questioned the
stranger, with an odd smile.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say just that," Mrs. Vinton
said, "but I will say that Mrs. Dainty's
little daughter, and Dorothy's little friend,
Nancy, and Flossie Barnet, are three of the
sweetest children I have ever met. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stay here is brighter and far pleasanter
because they are also here."</p>

<p>"Dorothy Dainty is an unusually fine
singer for a child," another lady said, "and
she is to sing for us to-night. I believe
Nancy Ferris is to do something, but I do
not know what. Does any one know if
Nancy sings?"</p>

<p>"I've not the least idea what her talent
is," said a pleasant-voiced matron, "but
she is such a bright, interesting child that
I feel sure that whatever she is able
to do at all, she will do exceedingly
well."</p>

<p>"Aunt Vera is to play a solo for the first
number," said little Flossie Barnet, to a
lady who sat near her.</p>

<p>"That is delightful," said the lady,
"and what are you to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll listen, and listen," said Flossie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"and then, I'll clap to show how much
I liked what the people did."</p>

<p>"And your friend Dorothy is to sing,"
said the lady, "do you know what Nancy
does?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do!" cried Flossie, "and she
does it so lovely, you'll wonder how she
could! I'm not to tell <i>what</i> she'll do, none
of us are to tell. You'll <i>see</i> when she does
it!"</p>

<p>"Dear little girl, you seem quite as
happy as if you were to be a soloist," said
the lady.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Flossie, "for when the
other little girls do pretty things, I see
them, but I couldn't see myself do anything!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you sweet, funny little girl," the
pleasant-faced lady said, as she drew Flossie
closer, "I never knew so dear a child."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dorothy and Nancy are dear," said
Flossie, "and oh, you haven't seen Molly
Merton! She's another one of my little
friends, and she's <i>always</i> lovely to play
with. We're always together when I'm at
home at Merrivale."</p>

<p>Before the lady could express regret that
she did not know Molly, the orchestra
began the opening chords of an overture.</p>

<p>The musicians gave an afternoon and
evening concert daily, throughout the season,
but to-night their numbers were to
be interspersed with solos given by the
guests.</p>

<p>The orchestra was generously applauded,
and then a slender figure in a gown of soft,
pink satin seated itself at the piano, and
with light touch and brilliant execution,
played a rondo that delighted all.</p>

<p>In response to repeated applause, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
played the "Caprice Hongroise," which
aroused wild enthusiasm.</p>

<p>She smiled, and bowed gracefully in acknowledgment,
then turning toward her
husband, who now stood beside her, took
from his hand the duplicate of the song that
he was to sing. She always played his accompaniments.</p>

<p>How full of music was his rare voice, how
like the tones of a silver trumpet when he
sang "A Song of the Sea," how tender his
tones when for a second number, he sang an
"Italian Love Song!"</p>

<p>"Didn't he sing <i>fine</i>, just <i>fine?</i>" Flossie
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Indeed he did," the lady replied, "I
never heard a more excellent voice."</p>

<p>"Well, he's my own Uncle Harry!" said
Flossie, a world of love and pride in her
voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>A young girl played a serenade on the
guitar, and a member of the orchestra
played a waltz for violin, and both were encored.</p>

<p>Those who were to perform were in a
small room awaiting their turn. They were
laughing and chatting while they waited,
and all, save a little girl, who kept apart
from the others, seemed bright and happy.
Her eyes were dull, and her red lips pouting.
It was Floretta Paxton, and she was
watching Nancy Ferris, noticing every detail
of her costume, and looking as unpleasant
as possible.</p>

<p>Nancy wore a frock of white gauze,
thickly strewn with tiny gold spangles.
Her girdle was white satin, her slippers
were white, and she wore a cluster of pink
rosebuds in her hair.</p>

<p>"What's she going to do?" Floretta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
asked in a fretful voice, but Mrs. Paxton,
who stood beside her, could not tell her
that. She knew no more of Nancy's talent
than Floretta did.</p>

<p>Floretta had been angry in the afternoon;
she had foolishly refused dinner, and was
very hungry; she was made more angry
because hers was not the first number on
the program, and now, here was Nancy Ferris
wearing a beautiful frock that far outshone
her own!</p>

<p>She was wearing a simple pink muslin,
and had felt that she was finely dressed,
until Nancy appeared.</p>

<p>The satin girdle, the white slippers, and
the spangles were more than she could forgive.</p>

<p>"What's she going to <i>do?</i>" she asked
again, more fretfully than before.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't know</i>," Mrs. Paxton said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I won't do a thing 'til I do
know!" said Floretta.</p>

<p>Silly little girl! Always a jealous child,
she now thought that Nancy <i>might</i> be another
impersonator or imitator, and she
was nearly wild.</p>

<p>The orchestra was now playing a dreamy
waltz. Nancy's foot tapped the measure.
Her eyes were brighter.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> she going to do?" whispered
Floretta.</p>

<p>The tall man, who had been announcing
the numbers, now swung aside the porti&egrave;re,
and Nancy slipped from her chair, ran out
upon the stage, and then,&mdash;oh, the fairy
motion of her arms, the lightness with
which, on the tips of her toes, she flew
across the stage!</p>

<p>With her finger-tips she lifted the hem of
her skirt, and courtesied low, then away in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a dreamy whirl she sped, turning to look
over her shoulder, and laugh at the faces
that showed greatest surprise.</p>

<p>On swept the strains of sweetest music,
and little Nancy, carried away with love of
the music, danced more charmingly than
ever before.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte and Mrs. Dainty watched
her flying figure, and often as they had seen
her, they knew that she was excelling herself.</p>

<p>"Nancy, Nancy, dear child!" murmured
Aunt Charlotte.</p>

<p>Now, with her feet crossed, and still on
the tips of her toes she whirled like a top,
did the graceful rocking step, swayed like
a flower in the wind, whirled about again,
courtesied once more, and laughing like a
merry, dark-eyed sprite, ran back into the
little waiting-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, what thunders of applause greeted
her, yet she sat quietly chatting with a lady
who stood near her!</p>

<p>Again and again they seemed to be begging
that the little dancer might return.</p>

<p>"I'll bow to them," said Nancy, and she
ran out to do so.</p>

<p>"Once more, once more!" cried an eager
voice, and then more clapping, and even a
few shrill whistles from some very young
men begged her to respond.</p>

<p>She extended her arms for a second, then
whirling rapidly, she repeated the last half
of the dance, courtesied again, and when
she ran back to the little room, Dorothy
embraced her tenderly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nancy darling!" she cried, "you
never danced finer. Do you know how
pleased every one is?"</p>

<p>"I danced to please and surprise them,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
said Nancy. "I <i>do</i> love to see people look
happy. They couldn't remember how hard
it was raining while I was whirling and
dancing for them."</p>

<p>Floretta, now more unhappy than before,
turned so that she might not see Nancy, nor
note the shimmer of her spangles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton, who had been talking with
a friend, now turned toward Floretta.</p>

<p>"Come!" she said, "now run out, and
do your very best, Floretta."</p>

<p>"I'm not going out!" said Floretta.</p>

<p>"What an idea!" cried Mrs. Paxton.
"Of course you'll run out, and show every
one how cute you are. Why, I planned this
entertainment just to give you a chance to
show off!"</p>

<p>"And made me the last one on the whole
list!" snarled Floretta.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried her mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"every one couldn't be first. I thought I'd
have the others perform first, and then <i>you</i>
could show who was the smartest! Come!
They're just wild to see what you can do,
and they're waiting."</p>

<p>"They'll <i>have</i> to wait!" hissed Floretta,
like a cross little cat.</p>

<p>It was no use to urge, plead, or insist.
Floretta was stubborn, and when once she
had determined what she would, or would
not do, nothing could move her.</p>

<p>Prayers and threats were equally useless.</p>

<p>Dorothy sang very sweetly, and was cordially
received.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry and his wife sang a charming
duet that delighted all, the orchestra
played a military caprice, and then the remainder
of the evening was spent in a little,
informal dance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>All was light, laughter, and music, and
there were two kinds of music that gladdened
their hearts,&mdash;the sweet music of the
violins, and the still sweeter melody of
happy voices!</p>

<p>Silly little Floretta had ruined the evening
for no one save her own jealous little
self.</p>

<p>Because she could not be the first on the
program, she would not appear at all, although,
at heart, she longed to show her
really clever mimicry. Later, after having
sulked during the early part of the evening,
she refused to join the dancers, and ran
away to her room, angry, very angry with
every one save the one person who was
really at fault,&mdash;herself.</p>

<p>Her efforts at imitating would surely
have amused, and would, doubtless, have
been well received. She was rather a graceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dancer, in any of the ordinary ballroom
dances, and she thus might have joined the
other children when the concert was over.
She had needlessly spent a most unhappy
evening.</p>

<p>Now, in her room, she heard the strains
of the orchestra, and for the first time realized
how foolish she had been.</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> a chance, and I lost it," she
sobbed, but her tears were not tears of
grieving. They were angry tears, and the
droll part of it was that while she alone was
at fault, she was angry with every one but
herself.</p>

<p>For a few moments she lay, her face hidden
in her pillow. Then, she turned over
into a more comfortable position, and softly
she whispered, "I'll do enough to-morrow
to make up!"</p>

<p>She did not say <i>what</i> she intended to do,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but the idea evidently pleased her, for she
laughed through her tears.</p>

<p>She sprang from her bed, found a box of
bonbons that her mother had won as a prize
in an afternoon whist party the day before,
and crept back into bed. When she had
eaten nearly all of the candy, she sat up
and in the softly shaded light, looked at
the box with its few remaining bits of
candy. She was wondering where she
could hide it.</p>

<p>"Ma will surely notice the empty box,
or anyway, I've made it <i>almost</i> empty," she
said. "She might not miss it if I hid it!"</p>

<p>She had never been taught to be honest,
so whenever she did a naughty thing, her
first thought was to hide, or cover up the
act. She never felt regret.</p>

<p>No one ever heard her gently say, "I'm
sorry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Softly she crept from her bed, and made
her way across the floor to the dressing-case.</p>

<p>She put the box upon the floor, and
pushed it well under it, and wholly out of
sight.</p>

<p>"There!" she whispered. "That's all
right. I would have finished the candy, but
I didn't want the whole of it. I ate the best
of it. The others weren't very nice."</p>

<p>Down in the long parlor the guests were
no longer dancing.</p>

<p>They were resting, and listening to a
lovely barcarolle played softly by the
orchestra.</p>

<p>Flossie, clinging to Uncle Harry's hand,
drew him toward the window.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said, as she parted the curtains.
"It isn't raining now, and the moon
is coming out. It will be pleasant to-morrow!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
And it has been lovely in here to-night."</p>

<p>"Dear little Flossie, dear little niece, it
was your cheery, loving nature that led
us to give your name to our baby. She
has two fine names, she is Beatrice Florence.
The first is Vera's mother's name,
the second, dear, is yours."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>IN A BIRCH ARBOR</h3>

<div class='cap'>THE storm had cleared the air, no mist
veiled the mountains, the sunlight lay
everywhere, gilding valley and stream.</div>

<p>Many of the guests had started early in
the morning for a trip to a distant mountain
from the summit of which a delightful view
might be enjoyed.</p>

<p>They were to ride over in the barge to
the base of the mountain, have a picnic
lunch under the trees, and then climb the
rugged path up the mountain side.</p>

<p>It would occupy half the day and it would
be afternoon before the barge would return
with its merry, tired party.</p>

<p>Floretta Paxton and Jack Tiverton were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
usually in sight, or, as they were always
noisy, within hearing might be nearer the
truth, but they had gone over to a spot that
the children called "The Pool," a bit of
water not much larger than a big puddle.</p>

<p>It existed only after a heavy rain, but
near its edge the slender birches grew, and
their silvery white trunks and the bright,
blue sky were clearly reflected on its surface.</p>

<p>Jack had decided to launch his toy boat
there, and, as Floretta had hemmed the
tiny sails, he had felt obliged to listen
to her coaxing, and permit her to go with
him.</p>

<p>"I'll let you christen her," he had said,
in a moment of generosity, and then regretted
it.</p>

<p>Floretta's idea of a christening ceremony<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was very elaborate, while Jack thought
that shouting the vessel's name, and shoving
it into the water was all that was necessary.</p>

<p>Nancy was helping Aunt Charlotte, so
when Dorothy ran out to the piazza, she
found it deserted, and she stood looking in
surprise at the rocking chairs and hammocks
that were swaying in the wind.</p>

<p>"Every one has gone somewhere," she
thought; "didn't any one stay at home?"</p>

<p>She stood for a moment in the doorway,
wondering what to do. Suddenly her face
brightened, and she clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" she said, and she
turned and hastened to her room to find her
latest gift.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful book of fairy tales, and
although it had been given her over a week
ago, she had read but a few of the stories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Mrs. Dainty had sent to the city for the
book, and ever since the day of its arrival
Dorothy had been wild to read it.</p>

<p>Something had been planned for each
sunny day, and as the weather had continued
fair, the book had been opened but
a few times, and then for only a brief glance
at the tales or the illustrations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty had gone to the village, a
ride of about an hour from the hotel, and
Aunt Charlotte was still occupied with her
letters.</p>

<p>Nancy was sealing and stamping the
envelopes, as Dorothy passed the door.</p>

<p>"I'm going over to the little 'birch
arbor,'" she said. "I'm taking my new
fairy book for company."</p>

<p>"I'll come, too, just as soon as I've
finished these envelopes," said Nancy, and
she began to work faster.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="396" height="500" alt="&quot;Oh, what a lovely, LOVELY story!&quot; said Dorothy.&mdash;Page 67." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Oh, what a lovely, <i>LOVELY</i> story!&quot; said Dorothy.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_67">Page 67</a></i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The "birch arbor" was not an actual
arbor, but it was a lovely spot, and the
birches were exceptionally fine. Nancy
and Dorothy had often been there together,
and they had given it the name.</p>

<p>A tiny mountain brook ran through it,
and it was a lovely spot in which to enjoy
legends or fairy tales.</p>

<p>In a few moments Dorothy had reached
the place, and when she had seated herself,
she opened the book where a fine picture
showed the prince, whose father had given
him three wishes as his only inheritance,
and then had sent him out to seek his fortune.</p>

<p>Twice she had commenced to read the
story, and had been obliged to lay it aside.
Now, with only the bees and the butterflies
hovering about her, she read the fascinating
tale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It proved to be even more charming than
she had expected.</p>

<p>The prince was tall, and dark, and handsome,
and his heart was so good and true,
that Dorothy felt that he richly deserved
the beautiful princess whom he finally won.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled as she read of the
great court wedding.</p>

<p>"And the lovely princess looked more
beautiful than ever in her wedding gown of
cloth of gold, thickly set with diamonds,
and her crown of diamonds and sapphires."</p>

<p>"Oh what a lovely, <i>lovely</i> story!" said
Dorothy, as she turned the page.</p>

<p>"Tiny princes carried her train, and as
the happy pair reached the palace gates,
and were about to enter the royal coach,
the blare of trumpets sounded, as the
guards in blue and gold played a gay fanfare."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Toot! Toot! Toot!"</p>

<p>Dorothy sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>It was as if those silver-toned trumpets
had sounded close beside her. A moment
more, and a huge automobile appeared
from behind the trees and shrubbery, and
slackening its speed, came, at last, to a
standstill, and an old lady leaned out to
question her.</p>

<p>"Are we going in the right direction,
my dear, to reach the Hotel Cleverton?"</p>

<p>Dorothy walked toward the car, and
looked up into the hard, old face.</p>

<p>"This little road is <i>right</i>," said Dorothy,
"but the broad road that leads out of this
one is not so rough, and it is a <i>little</i>
shorter."</p>

<p>"There, Minturn, I <i>said plainly</i> that I
believed we could get there quicker some
other way!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are <i>sure</i> about the Cleverton?"
the old lady asked. "You <i>know</i> where it
is?"</p>

<p>"I'm staying there with mamma, and
that truly is the right way," said Dorothy,
her soft eyes looking up into the hard, old
face.</p>

<p>"I guess I can trust you," the old lady
said, not smiling, but looking a bit less
stern.</p>

<p>"Now, Minturn, we'll <i>try</i> to reach the
hotel, sometime before dark!" she said
curtly.</p>

<p>Puffing and whirring the big automobile
started off up the road, the old lady sitting
stern and erect, as if she thought her driver
needed watching, and she was determined
to keep a sharp eye upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, how queer!" said Dorothy.
"She didn't even say 'good-bye,' or 'good-morning.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Perhaps she was very tired, and
forgot,"&mdash;then after a moment she added,
"but my beautiful mamma <i>never</i> forgets."</p>

<p>She went back to the pretty spot where
she had been reading, and sitting down,
opened the book, but she could not keep her
mind upon the stories. The strange face
of the old lady seemed to look at her from
the printed page.</p>

<p>How small and sharp her eyes had been,
and how she asked the same question again
and again. Did she doubt the answer given
her?</p>

<p>All these, and many more questions puzzled
Dorothy, and with the open book lying
upon her lap, she looked off where the sunlight
lay upon the grass.</p>

<p>She was still sitting thus when a merry
voice aroused her, and she turned to see
Nancy running toward her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Dorothy!" she cried. "You ought
to have been up at the hotel just a few
moments ago. A new guest came, and
she was so cross, it <i>must</i> be that she didn't
want to come. But if she truly <i>didn't</i> want
to, then why <i>did</i> she?"</p>

<p>"Why, Nancy, who wouldn't think it
fine to come up here to the mountains, and
stay at the Cleverton?" said Dorothy in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't have thought the
old lady was glad to be there, if you'd seen
her," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"Oh, was it an old lady that you were
talking about?" Dorothy asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you ought to have seen her
eyes snap when she scolded her chauffeur.
She told him she might have arrived an
hour before just as well as not, and she
kept right on scolding to herself, all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
way up to the piazza, and, Dorothy, she
looked so cross, I wouldn't wonder if she
was scolding up in her room now!"</p>

<p>"She must be the same one that was
here just a little while ago," Dorothy said,
"and she asked me to tell her the nearest
way to the Cleverton. When I told her,
she made the man rush off over the road,
and she was scolding him when they
left here. Perhaps she was tired, and
will feel pleasanter when she has
rested."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Nancy, "but I know
Aunt Charlotte and your mamma don't act
that way when they are tired."</p>

<p>Dorothy could not dispute that, and soon
the two little girls were enjoying the fairy
book together.</p>

<p>"Now, this is the story I've just been
reading," said Dorothy, "and this is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
picture of the prince. Isn't he handsome?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Nancy, "and doesn't he
look like Flossie's Uncle Harry?"</p>

<p>"Why, he <i>does</i>, truly," cried Dorothy.
"I'll show the picture to Flossie, and I'm
sure she'll say it looks ever so much like
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, she will," agreed Nancy.</p>

<p>"Why, it would look <i>exactly</i> like him, if
<i>he</i> only had a cap with plumes," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry, coming briskly up the path,
was just in time to hear the last few words.</p>

<p>"I'm very curious to know who it is who
needs a cap with plumes," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, who knew you were right here to
hear it?" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Oh, was it a state secret?" he asked.
"Well, now it's a pity I heard it, but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it happens I <i>did</i>, I think I must ask for the
rest of the secret."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>would</i> you tell?" Dorothy asked,
turning to Nancy, but before she could
reply, Uncle Harry spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm really too curious," he said, "so I
think I'll threaten to sit on this stump,
until you tell me the secret, and let me tell
you two little friends, that <i>I've</i> a secret;
it's a nice one, too, but,&mdash;" he paused to
watch the effect of his words.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;But&mdash;" they cried.</p>

<p>"But,&mdash;" said Uncle Harry, "I
wouldn't tell mine <i>first!</i>"</p>

<p>Wag that he was, he could not resist the
temptation to tease just a bit.</p>

<p>Dorothy took the pretty book, and opening
it at the page that showed the picture
of the prince, she said, "We only said the
brave prince looked like you, no, I mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
you look like him, and we said you'd
look <i>just</i> like him if you had a cap with
plumes."</p>

<p>Uncle Harry appeared to study the picture
very carefully. After a moment, he
said:</p>

<p>"That's a fine compliment, but there's
one thing about it that worries me, so I'll
have to ask about it.</p>

<p>"In this picture the prince wears a blue
blouse and a pair of green shoes, a pink cap
with white plumes, gray hose, and crimson
trunks. Now, if I should decide to purchase
a pink cap with white plumes, would
you expect me to come out arrayed in all
those colors? I really feel that the costume
is a <i>bit</i>, just a <i>bit</i> too gay."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll not ask you to be quite as gay
as that," said Dorothy, "and we'll promise
one thing. We won't even ask you to buy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a pink cap if you'll tell us your secret
now."</p>

<p>He laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I really <i>ought</i> to keep it a
little longer. How would it do if I should
tell you my secret some time next week?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" they cried, "tell it now!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, there's to be a fair 'way
down in the village, a real country fair, and
I'm intending to hire a barge, and take all
of the <i>very</i> young ladies over with me to see
the fun. I mean ladies as young as you, and
Nancy, and Flossie. I shall invite all the
wee ladies that are stopping at the hotel,
and I shall take all who accept."</p>

<p>He looked into their bright faces, and
laughed when Dorothy said:</p>

<p>"As if <i>any</i> little girl <i>wouldn't</i> accept!"</p>

<p>"You mustn't expect it to be a grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
affair. It will be, as I said, a real old-fashioned
country fair, but there will be a
jolly ride over there, and the return trip,
and I fancy you will enjoy it all," he said,
"and I shall have the delight of giving
pleasure."</p>

<p>A friend who had been looking for Uncle
Harry, now appeared on the winding path,
a clump of large trees having hidden his
approach.</p>

<p>The two young men started off for a long
tramp, and Dorothy and Nancy walked
slowly back to the hotel.</p>

<p>"The prince <i>did</i> look like Uncle Harry,"
said Nancy, "and the picture of the
naughty old fairy that enchanted the sleeping
beauty, looks like the lady that came
this morning, and was so very cross."</p>

<p>"Then that <i>is</i> the same one who stopped
to ask the way, for she looked just like that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I'll always think, every time I look at her,
that she's the black fairy."</p>

<p>And when they ran up on to the piazza,
there sat the very person whom they had
been speaking of, looking somewhat cooler
with her long travelling cloak removed.</p>

<p>Her black gown was of some thin material,
and just as the two little girls ran up
on to the piazza, she dropped the large,
black fan that she had been wielding.</p>

<p>Nancy, who was nearer to her than
Dorothy, picked up the fan for her. Without
a smile, she took the fan, and they
heard some slight sound. Possibly it might
have been a softly murmured word of
thanks, but it did not sound like it.</p>

<p>"She seems very strange," said Dorothy,
"but perhaps she's still tired."</p>

<p>She was always unwilling to say that any
one was wilfully rude or disagreeable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>And now Aunt Charlotte, with Mrs.
Dainty, came out to enjoy the fine air, and
Dorothy and Nancy ran to them to tell them
of the treat that Uncle Harry had in store
for them.</p>

<p>"It's only a few days to wait, and isn't
he kind to take us?" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"He is indeed," said Mrs. Dainty, "and
I hope all his little friends will be very
thoughtful, and make him just as little
trouble as possible. He takes quite a care
in inviting so many children."</p>

<p>"Oh, all the children love him, and there
isn't one who would want to be any bother,
unless it was Floretta," said Dorothy,
"and perhaps she'll be having such a nice
time, she won't think to be naughty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty smiled at this view of it.
She could not help thinking that Floretta
never needed time to think in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to be disagreeable, but she did not say
so.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte Grayson, seeing the
stranger sitting alone, paused near her
chair to say a friendly word.</p>

<p>She remained but few moments, however,
because the woman seemed not inclined
to talk.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte well knew that the
stranger was not courteous, but she tried
to think, as Dorothy had, that fatigue, after
a long journey, made her eager for silence
and rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE MOUNTAIN PARTY</h3>

<div class='cap'>AS the days flew by, the stranger became
a bit more friendly, conversing
sometimes with Mrs. Dainty and Aunt
Charlotte, but often, far more often, with
Mrs. Paxton.</div>

<p>It was not that she sought to become acquainted
with Floretta's mother; it was,
rather, that Mrs. Paxton seemed determined
to force the friendship.</p>

<p>"Her name is Fenton, Mrs. Fenton, and
isn't it odd, <i>my</i> name was Fenton before I
married. Floretta's middle name is Fenton.
I really feel almost as if I were related
to her, because of the name," declared Mrs.
Paxton one morning, whereupon Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Fenton, coming out on to the piazza, remarked:</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton blushed and hesitated, then
recovering herself, she said:</p>

<p>"I was just telling these ladies of my
friendly feeling for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" Mrs. Fenton repeated, as
she sank into a large rocker, and looked off
across the valley to the distant mountains.</p>

<p>After a few moments she seemed to have
lost interest in the view, and, taking up a
small embroidery frame, commenced to ply
her needle as if she were eager to finish the
pretty doily.</p>

<p>Two little figures came slowly up the
path to the piazza. They were returning
from the christening of the little boat.</p>

<p>"What is wrong, Jack? You don't look
very happy," said Mrs. Tiverton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"He wanted me to christen his boat, but
he wouldn't give it my name!" said Floretta,
before Jack could reply.</p>

<p>"She thought just because she hemmed
the sails I'd name it the <i>Floretta</i>, but I
wouldn't, so I shoved it into the water myself,
and shouted <i>Carlotta</i>. That's the name
of a girl that goes to my school, and I like
her."</p>

<p>"You say Floretta hemmed your sails,"
said Mrs. Tiverton.</p>

<p>"Well, I thanked her for that, and I let
her go to the launching, and I let her christen
it, but I don't see that I need name it
for her," said Jack, stoutly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton had not heeded what the
children were saying. One might have fancied
that she did not hear, although both
Floretta and Jack stood quite near her
chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>A large spool that she had wound with
colored silk slipped from her lap, and rolled
toward Floretta.</p>

<p>"Pick it up, dear," Mrs. Paxton said.</p>

<p>"Don't want to," said Floretta.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton stooped, and recovered the
spool, and, taking her embroidery frame in
her hand, left the piazza, and mounted the
stairs to her room.</p>

<p>"Why <i>were</i> you so rude?" said Mrs.
Paxton, but Floretta, perching upon the
low railing, began softly humming "Yankee
Doodle."</p>

<p>Jack Tiverton, espying a boy that he
knew, whistled loudly, and then, as the
other boy turned, ran after him, the two
whooping and shouting like savages.</p>

<p>"It is almost lunch time, Jack!" Mrs.
Tiverton cried, and the boy turned, and
waved his hand to show that he heard her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys aren't apt to forget meal time,"
muttered old Mr. Cunningham behind his
paper.</p>

<p>True enough, Jack returned in ample
time, and was the first at the table.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon Dorothy and
Nancy went out for a drive with Romeo.</p>

<p>It was one of those sunny days that tempt
nearly every one to ride or walk.</p>

<p>The mountain roads were rather lonely,
and Mrs. Dainty insisted that whether Dorothy
were riding Romeo, or driving in the
phaeton, the groom must ride at a little distance
behind her.</p>

<p>There were the lovely, slender birches on
either side of the roads, there were patches
of bright green moss upon which the sunlight
rested, there were blackberry vines
and woodbine wreathing the low stone
walls, and here and there a mullein raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
its stately head from its base of velvet
leaves.</p>

<p>Oh, it seemed like an enchanted country,
where new beauties were to be found on
either hand!</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Dorothy, "close beside
that mullein is an evening primrose, and
their blossoms are the same color."</p>

<p>Then a tiny chipmunk sprang upon the
wall, sat erect, and watched them for a moment,
then ran up the trunk of a slender
tree, where from a low branch he watched
until they had passed. Then back to the
wall he sprang, where he chattered as if
scolding the little girls who had disturbed
his solitude. It may be that, instead, he
was talking to himself, and telling what
charming little girls they were.</p>

<p>A long way from the hotel they passed
Jack Tiverton, with a number of other boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who were staying at a hotel a few miles
distant from the Cleverton.</p>

<p>They were all somewhat larger than
Jack, and he thought it fine to be with them.</p>

<p>He had met them at a ball game three
weeks before, and he had been very busy
holding their acquaintance ever since.</p>

<p>"We're going to catch the echo, and
keep it, too!" shouted Jack.</p>

<p>"It's mocking you now," said Dorothy,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Jack, "but we'll catch
it, and fasten it so it can't get away."</p>

<p>"<i>How</i> will you fasten an echo?" Nancy
asked, turning, and looking over her shoulder
as the little phaeton sped past.</p>

<p>"Trust us to find a way!" cried Jack,
and the others laughed as if they already
knew exactly how to do it.</p>

<p>They left the road, and, vaulting over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wall, crossed the open field, singing a gay,
rollicking song as they went.</p>

<p>"They just <i>say</i> they're going hunting for
the echo," said Dorothy, "and they say it
for fun, but I wonder where they are
going, and what they truly are going to
do."</p>

<p>The groom, riding nearer, touched his
hat.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Dorothy, I heard the lads
saying that there's an old house over near
that mountain, where a hermit lived years
ago, and they're off to find it if they
can."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't they say so, instead
of telling such a tale about catching the
echo?" Dorothy asked.</p>

<p>"They were saying that they wanted to
find the hut, and hunt in it, and around it
ter find things the old fellow may have hidden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
They feared you or Miss Nancy might
tell some other lad. They're wanting it all
to themselves."</p>

<p>Having told this bit of information, the
groom allowed the carriage to pass him,
and once more rode behind it.</p>

<p>The two little girls talked of the long
tramp that the boys would have before they
would find the hermit's hut.</p>

<p>"And perhaps they won't find it at all,
after all their hunting," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope they will," said Dorothy,
"because it's so horrid to hunt and hunt,
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" she cried a moment later.
"See the lovely mosses! Let's take some
back to mamma and Aunt Charlotte."</p>

<p>They were, indeed, beautiful. There was
green moss that looked like velvet, and
gray moss formed like tiny cups with scarlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
edges, and other moss tipped with
red.</p>

<p>On an old stump they found shell-like
fungus, some a creamy white, others white,
with soft brown markings.</p>

<p>Oh, a fine collection of rarely beautiful
mosses and lichens they gathered, and
heaped on the bottom of the phaeton.</p>

<p>Romeo turned his head to watch them as
if he wondered when they would have gathered
enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, we do keep you standing, dear,
don't we?" Dorothy said, patting his neck
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't look for sugar,"
she said, laughing, "for I haven't any
with me, but we'll get you some fresh
clover."</p>

<p>With Nancy's help she soon had a fine
bunch of pink clover for Romeo, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
seemed quite as pleased as if it had been
the cubes that he so often enjoyed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When the party of boys had left the road
to cross the fields that lay between them,
and the forest at the foot of the mountain,
they had believed that they knew
exactly how to go to reach the hermit's
hut.</p>

<p>The old hermit had been dead for years,
but every season the summer guests at the
hotels and farmhouses searched all around
the deserted hut, expecting to find some
relic to take home and label as a bit of the
hermit's property.</p>

<p>The boys supposed that they had the
woods to themselves, and that they would
be uninterrupted in their search of the
place.</p>

<p>They did not know that the mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
climbers had taken the same direction, intending,
before they enjoyed their lunch
beneath the trees, to stop at the old, deserted
house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton and little Floretta had
worked more persistently than any others
of the party, and Mrs. Paxton had found
a small, brass button.</p>

<p>The others had laughed at the prize, asking
her if she intended to keep it as a souvenir.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mrs. Paxton. "I'm
sure this brass button must have belonged
on some old coat that the hermit
wore!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps in his youth, before he came
up here to live, he may have been a janitor,"
said a young man, with a saucy
laugh.</p>

<p>"Or a brakeman," suggested another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton pretended not to hear their
teasing, and though the prize that she had
found had been only a valueless thing, she
kept it.</p>

<p>Floretta was very eager to stay, and continue
to peep into cracks in the floor and
walls, and to poke with a stick under the
doorsill, and in the soft earth around the
hut.</p>

<p>The older members of the party knew
that if they were to ascend the mountain,
see the view, and descend before twilight,
they must start at once.</p>

<p>As soon as their picnic lunch had been
enjoyed they commenced to climb the
rugged mountain path.</p>

<p>It was very steep and rough, and it had
been said that no children should be allowed
in the party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton had insisted that her small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
daughter was a wonderful little climber,
who was quite equal to the demands of a
long tramp.</p>

<p>Floretta had wished to remain at the hut,
but as she could not do that, she proceeded
to make herself as unpleasant as possible,
by complaining every step of the way, until
one young man voiced the feeling of the
entire party.</p>

<p>"This is a horrid, rough old path, and
I'm tired. I wish I'd stayed at <i>home!</i>"
said Floretta.</p>

<p>"I wish so, <i>too!</i>" said the young man,
and several of the party, too polite to say
it, at heart, agreed with him.</p>

<p>Floretta's was the only gloomy face,
however. The others tramped gaily onward,
singing snatches of song, and laughing
as they stepped upon rolling stones, or
tripped over long, gnarled roots that rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
above the surface, as if especially designed
to catch lagging feet.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"All day upon the hills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We've chased the chamois far,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But deeper joy now thrills</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath the evening star."</span><br />
</div>

<p>The youth sang gaily, and several of
his friends joined him in singing the old
song.</p>

<p>Arrived at the summit they rested, enjoyed
the view, laughed and joked about
their weariness, and made many wild
guesses as to how long it would take them
to make the descent and drive back to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"It will be three o'clock before we reach
the Cleverton," said one.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried another, "this is
really called a mountain by courtesy. It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
only a big hill. I say we shall be on the
piazza, and wondering what we can do next,
as early as half-past two."</p>

<p>"It's more likely to be half-past <i>three!</i>"
declared another, and when all felt sufficiently
rested, they commenced the descent.</p>

<p>Floretta refused to keep closely beside
her mother, insisting upon clinging to another
member of the party, to whom she
had taken a fancy.</p>

<p>The party was a large one, much larger,
indeed, than had at first been planned, and
while half of the number were guests at the
Cleverton, the others were from the Merlington,
a hotel situated nearer the village,
and from several large farmhouses that entertained
summer boarders.</p>

<p>The guests from the Cleverton had kept
closely together during the trip, while those
from the Merlington had done the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the foot of the mountain,
and were tramping along a path that
ran nearly parallel to that on which the
hermit's house stood.</p>

<p>Floretta saw the boys, near the house,
and also saw that Jack Tiverton was with
them.</p>

<p>Without a word, she left the lady to
whose arm she had been clinging, and making
her way along behind bushes and underbrush,
she managed to sneak in at the
door of the hut, without having been seen
by the party of boys.</p>

<p>The lady, with whom she had been walking,
supposed that she had run back to join
her mother, while Mrs. Paxton felt quite
undisturbed, because she believed that her
little girl was still clinging to the arm of
the lady with whom she had chosen to
walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>It had required two barges to convey the
party, and now they found them waiting,
the horses a bit impatient to be off.</p>

<p>The guests from the Merlington clambered
into the first barge, and they with a
few of the farmhouse party filled it to overflowing,
some of the men being obliged to
ride homeward, seated upon the steps.
Meanwhile the Cleverton people were
forced to wait until the barge for their
party drove up.</p>

<p>The first barge had started, and was rolling
along, and a chorus of college songs was
wafted back on the breeze, while handkerchiefs
fluttered as the gay passengers
laughed at the crowd that had not yet
started.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton paused with her foot on the
step, and looked back.</p>

<p>"Why, where's Floretta?" she asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the first barge," cried a voice in
reply.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure?</i>" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said the other, "she's
with that tall, fine-looking lady from the
Merlington. She'll be home before you
are."</p>

<p>The second barge was soon filled and on
its way. The horses were less fresh than
those of the first barge, and seemed determined
to lag. Indeed, they required constant
urging to keep them from dropping
into a slow walk.</p>

<p>"Those other fellows ahead of us started
some lively college songs," said a disgusted
passenger, "and they're actually out of
sight now; but the way these nags are poking
I couldn't think of anything to sing
that would be slow enough to be appropriate."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>And while one barge was going over the
road at a lively rate of speed, and the other
jogging along at a snail's pace, Floretta, at
the hut, was having a most exciting time.</p>

<p>Once inside the place, she had crouched
beneath a window to learn, if possible, what
the boys were talking about.</p>

<p>She had wanted to remain there when the
party had started for the mountain path,
and she had been very impatient during the
long tramp. She cared nothing for the
view, and determined, on the return, to
stop, if only for a few moments, at the hut.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE ECHO CAPTURED</h3>

<div class='cap'>FLORETTA had intended to hunt for
treasure, hoping to get something more
valuable than the brass button that her
mother had found.</div>

<p>She was not at all afraid of Jack Tiverton,
but of those larger boys she was not
quite sure.</p>

<p>As she knelt beneath the window she
could hear only the voices of the boys that
were nearest to the hut, and hearing only
parts of their conversation, she could not
understand what the first speaker expected
to find.</p>

<p>"If I find it, I'll put it where it will be
safe," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a voice more
distant replied.</p>

<p>She did not hear what it said, but she did
hear the answer made by the boy who had
first spoken.</p>

<p>"If the ghost of the old hermit was in
the hut, it might hear you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and what would he say about your
hunting for things that may have belonged
to him?" said another, with a teasing
laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid," was the careless
answer.</p>

<p>"You're not?" jeered a laughing
voice.</p>

<p>"I think we've poked around out here
long enough without finding anything,"
said Jack Tiverton, "let's hunt inside the
house."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," called a boy who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
not yet spoken, "just till I've looked into
this hollow tree trunk."</p>

<p>"And <i>then</i> what?" asked a merry voice.</p>

<p>"<i>Then</i> hunt in the house, of course!"
was the curt reply.</p>

<p>Floretta thought she saw a chance for
fun.</p>

<p>Softly, yet quickly, she crept up the rickety
little stairway, built close against the
wall, and leading to the tiny loft.</p>

<p>The loft was really little more than a
space beneath the roof where the old hermit
might have stored a few provisions.
She could not stand, or even sit, erect, and
she crouched upon the bit of dusty flooring.</p>

<p>She was none too soon, for in a few seconds
the boys rushed in, and then began a
discussion as to whether it would be safe
to take a plank up from the floor to look
beneath it for hidden treasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"You oughtn't to do that," said Jack
Tiverton, "somebody might arrest you,
or all of us, if folks found out we did
it."</p>

<p>"Arrest us for spoiling a floor in this old
hut!" cried an older boy. "I wonder you
don't think the old hermit might holler if
he heard us pull up a plank!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack stoutly, "you'd be as
scared as I would if he did holler!"</p>

<p>"You're a small boy, Jack, and easily
scared," was the taunting reply.</p>

<p>"Well, pull up a plank, and see what
happens. I dare you to!" cried Jack.</p>

<p>"Here goes then!" said the older boy,
and catching hold of a plank that had rotted
at one end, he pulled it up.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, let it alone!</i>" groaned a boy in a
farther corner of the room, in an attempt to
imitate an old voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Oh, let it alone!</i>" came in exactly the
same voice from the loft.</p>

<p>Sidney Cumston, the big boy, who had
laughed at little Jack Tiverton, dropped
the plank, and turned pale, while not a boy
spoke or moved.</p>

<p>"Come, come!" said Sidney, when he
caught his breath, "we're a precious pack
of sillies! Help me lift this big board, will
you?"</p>

<p>"Will you?" came from the loft, in
the very manner in which he had said
it.</p>

<p>Again he dropped the plank.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" cried Sidney.</p>

<p>"Mean?" came his last word repeated.</p>

<p>The boys were now thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Sidney, "let's leave
here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here!" came a repetition of his last
word, and big as he was, he had turned to
run, when a faint ripple of smothered
laughter came down from the loft.</p>

<p>Immediately Sidney's pale face flushed
red. It flashed through his mind that these
younger boys had seen that he was frightened.</p>

<p>He had been laughed at by the owner of
the voice that had mocked him, and the
boys would <i>never</i> stop laughing.</p>

<p>Quickly he mounted the steps, and
roughly he dragged little Floretta from her
hiding place, half carrying her down the
stairway, because it was too narrow for
two to descend.</p>

<p>"So you thought it was funny, just
<i>funny</i> to mock us, did you?" he asked,
when they reached the floor.</p>

<p>Floretta was not laughing now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>She was sullen, and at the same time
frightened.</p>

<p>What would they do to her?</p>

<p>They crowded around her, frowning and
making all sorts of wild suggestions as to
what should be done with her.</p>

<p>"Keep her mocking till she's got enough
of it!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Put her back in the loft, and leave her
there! She seemed to like there," said another.</p>

<p>The big boy, whose hand was still on her
shoulder, was more angry than either of the
others.</p>

<p>He was a bully, always ready to torment
some one smaller than himself.</p>

<p>He had reason to be provoked with Floretta,
and the fact that she was only a little
girl, made no impression upon him.</p>

<p>He would as willingly punish a girl, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
boy, and the fact that his captive was
smaller than he, only proved that the task
would be an easy one.</p>

<p>"You think it's smart to imitate, and it
is. P'raps you think you're the echo that's
over in the mountain!" he sneered.</p>

<p>She made no answer. She was crying
now.</p>

<p>"Say! Let her off!" cried Jack Tiverton.
"She's only a girl!"</p>

<p>The smallest boy in the crowd, he saw
Sidney's cowardice.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you sweet on Floretta?" jeered
Sidney.</p>

<p>Jack drew back abashed. He did not
like Floretta at all, but he did think it
mean for a big boy to frighten so small a
girl.</p>

<p>"I ain't going to hurt you," said Sidney,
"but I'm going to give you a chance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
play echo, till you're tired of it. I guess
you'll get enough of it before you get
through!</p>

<p>"Come, fellows! Get some good long
pieces of wild grape-vine! I'll fasten Miss
Echo where she can shout all day, and nobody'll
stop her!"</p>

<p>"I won't go with you!" screamed Floretta,
who had found her voice, "You sha'n't
tie me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" said Sidney, in a teasing
tone. "We'll tie you so you can't get
away!"</p>

<p>She pulled back.</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" said Sidney, grasping
her arm with a firmer hold.</p>

<p>"Now, walk right along, or these other
fellows will help me carry you!" he added,
and Floretta thought best to walk.</p>

<p>"Where'll you take her?" asked one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right there," said Sidney. "That
rock is just covered with vines that cling
fast to it. Hurry, now! Pull down some
long, strong pieces! Here, you scratch like
a cat! Stop that!"</p>

<p>Floretta, half wild to get away, was attacking
his hand in the manner of a little
wild animal.</p>

<p>"Let me go, then!" she screamed.</p>

<p>"Not much!" cried Sidney, and with the
help of another boy, he dragged her, screaming
and kicking, all the way, until they
reached the rocky ledge.</p>

<p>"There, now! Hold on! You're showing
too much temper!" cried a stout lad
who was helping to bind her.</p>

<p>"I won't stay! You sha'n't tie me!" she
screamed, but without replying, they drew
the tough vines closer about her, lashing her
into such a network of stems and stout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
vines that it would be impossible for her to
escape.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Sidney, when he felt sure
that she was securely made a little prisoner,
"You can shout till you're tired, and
if you want to mock any one, you can mock
yourself! Good-afternoon, Miss Echo!"</p>

<p>He lifted his cap, with elaborate courtesy,
and marched off whistling:</p>

<div class='center'>
"The Girl I Left Behind Me."<br />
</div>

<p>They did not look back. Sidney marched
boldly away, believing that he had done a
very smart thing, but the other boys felt
less comfortable.</p>

<p>They had been angry with her, and they
had wished to see her punished, but they
could not help thinking that she was a little
girl, and they were leaving her alone in the
woods!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack Tiverton was, by far, the most uneasy.</p>

<p>He was the smallest of the party, and,
while he had asked Sidney to let Floretta
go, he had known it was useless to do
more.</p>

<p>The eight other boys were stronger than
he, and any attempt upon his part to free
her would be worse than useless. They
would not listen, but instead, would pounce
upon him.</p>

<p>The other boys talked, laughed, and whistled,
to imply that they were not thinking
of what they had done, but all the way back
to the Cleverton, little Jack was wondering
what he could do.</p>

<p>He dared not go straight to Floretta's
mother, and tell her of her little girl's
plight.</p>

<p>He knew if he did that, the boys would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
soon learn who had played "tell-tale," and
then,&mdash;what would they do to <i>him?</i></p>

<p>And yet, he was determined, in some way,
to help Floretta.</p>

<p>How could he let a little girl stay out
there in the woods all night?</p>

<p>Of course some one, walking through the
woods might find her, but if no one happened
to?</p>

<p>Jack knew that the risk was too great.
It was just before he reached the Cleverton,
that he thought of the best way that he
could do it.</p>

<p>He would write a note to Mrs. Paxton.
He would drop that note into the mail box
that hung at the side door. The letters were
always distributed at four, and Sidney Cumston,
who had a fine watch, had just said
that it was three. He left the boys at the
entrance to the Merlington, and hurried on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that he might have plenty of time for his
note.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiverton was out driving with a
friend, and Jack had quite a hunt before he
could find pencil or paper for his note.</p>

<p>At last he found a blank book, and with
a pencil he wrote this note.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Deer Mrs. Paxton:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yor litle girl is tied up in the woods
opsite the hermits hut. You better go get
her real quick or somethin may happen too
her.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"Yors trooly."<br />
</div></div>

<p>He folded it, and, in place of the envelope
that he could not find, he tied around it a
bit of string that he found in his pocket.</p>

<p>Boldly he addressed it, in very large letters,
and sneaking down the stairway, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
around on the piazza toward the side door,
watched his chance, and slipped it into the
mail box.</p>

<p>There was much excitement on the front
piazza, because the guests had arrived in
the barge but a few moments before, and
Mrs. Paxton had given a maid a generous
"tip" to go over to the Merlington, and
bring Floretta back with her.</p>

<p>"She returned with the party that came
from the Merlington, and I don't wish her
to remain there. I want her to come right
back to me," said Mrs. Paxton.</p>

<p>"Very well, ma'am," the maid had replied,
and with the coins in her hand, had
started off at once toward the other hotel.</p>

<p>When little Jack Tiverton ran around to
the front piazza, the maid had just returned.</p>

<p>"If you please, Mrs. Paxton, your little
girl isn't over to the Merlington, and hasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
been there, and a lady that was with the
party that came home from the mountain
trip, says the child wasn't in their barge at
all. I asked her if she was <i>sure</i>, and she
said, she couldn't help being sure, because
there wasn't <i>any</i> child in their barge."</p>

<p>Of course excitement reigned supreme.
Mrs. Paxton seemed half wild, and every
one shared her anxiety.</p>

<p>The fact that Floretta was not a favorite
made no difference. No one liked to think
of a little girl out there alone on the mountain
path, or in the woods, especially as it
was already late afternoon.</p>

<p>"What a dreadful thing!" cried Mrs.
Paxton, wringing her hands, and walking
up and down the piazza.</p>

<p>"Who will go with me? I cannot go
alone, and where, <i>where</i> shall we look first?
Who saw her last?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment a man-servant came out
from the hall with a tray of letters that he
began to distribute.</p>

<p>"One for you, Mrs. Paxton," said the
man, as he touched her arm gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't think of letters now," she
said, but something about the note seemed
so unusual that she looked at it.</p>

<p>She drew off the string that had been
loosely tied, and read the hastily scrawled
lines.</p>

<p>She screamed, and Aunt Charlotte, who
was standing near her, put her arm around
her and supported her, or she would have
fallen.</p>

<p>Many of those who gathered around Mrs.
Paxton were inclined to think the note a
hoax, but Mrs. Dainty, coming forward,
lifted her handsome head, and looking
at the men who were lounging comfortably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in the large rockers, or sitting upon the
piazza railing, spoke the word that spurred
them to action.</p>

<p>"Is it safe to <i>guess</i> that this is a joke?
True, it is written in a boyish hand, and
while it <i>may</i> be a boy's joke, may it not be
a boy's means of telling us what has actually
happened? I would not, were I a man,
take the responsibility or chance, of leaving
Floretta out there, because I would go to
the place, and thus learn, not guess, if this
information be true."</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished speaking when
a number of men rose, and one, who chose
to lead the party, lifted his hat to Mrs.
Dainty, saying:</p>

<p>"We are off, madam. We only needed
an inspiration to move us to endeavor."</p>

<p>She bowed and smiled, as she said:</p>

<p>"One thing I ask of you. Go as quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
as possible, for the sake of the frightened
child, and the anxious mother."</p>

<p>"In all possible haste," was the quick
reply, and she turned to offer what comfort
she might to the woman who seemed nearly
distracted.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And all this time, what had been happening
in the wood? For a long time Floretta
had cried, screamed, and shouted, hoping
that the boys would come back and release
her.</p>

<p>Then, when she knew that they must be
too far away to hear her, she tore at the
clasping bonds, trying in every way to free
herself. With feet and hands she strove
to loosen the tough, wiry vines, kicking and
trampling with her restless feet, beating
and bending with her little hands, until
they were torn and bleeding, and the tormenting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
vines seemed only to hold her with
a firmer grasp, as if to prove how useless
was her struggle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">

<span class="caption">With feet and hands she strove to loosen the tough, wiry vines.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_119">Page 119</a></i>.</span>
</div>

<p>She had cried until she could cry no more,
and the sturdy vines had cut and bruised
her.</p>

<p>So firmly was she bound that she could
not sink to the grass to rest, and she
had only the hard, rocky ledge to lean
against.</p>

<p>How still the woodland seemed! Sometimes
a twig would snap, or a buzzing insect
would pause, as if to look at her, but
no one came to set her free.</p>

<p>She waited for a moment to regain her
breath, and then again she fought and struggled
with those tough, sturdy vines.</p>

<p>She tried to wrench them apart, to break,
to tear them from her, but they only yielded
enough to bend, and then snap back into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the very place that she had pushed them
from.</p>

<p>Not a vine broke, not a stem gave way,
and she set her lips tightly for yet greater
effort!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FLORETTA'S RETURN</h3>

<div class='cap'>AT a far corner of the piazza sat Dorothy,
her eyes terrified, and her cheeks
pale. Nancy, close beside her, wound her
arms about her, and sought, in every way,
to comfort her.</div>

<p>"They'll find her soon, Dorothy, so don't
you be frightened," she whispered.
"They'll <i>surely</i> find her soon."</p>

<p>Dear little Nancy knew, better than any
of Dorothy's other friends could have
known, how ready was her sympathy, how
kind and loving was her heart.</p>

<p>She had not loved Floretta, but with
Dorothy, that did not count. It was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
dreadful fear that something had happened
to a little girl, who, so recently had been at
play with them,&mdash;ah, that was what
grieved sweet Dorothy.</p>

<p>She was thinking of what Mrs. Dainty
had said to Aunt Charlotte when the mountain
trip was first talked of.</p>

<p>"I think the long tramp is a rougher
form of amusement than I can well endure.
I should be so weary long before it was time
to return, that I should derive but little
pleasure from the trip. There is another
thought in connection with the picnic," she
continued, "and that is an element of danger.
Not great danger perhaps, but such
that I would not join the party, nor would
I permit Dorothy, or Nancy to do so. One
gentleman who was talking of the mountain
path that they have chosen, spoke of
the great danger to the climbers from small,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
rolling stones, and from places where the
earth seems to crumble near the edge of the
narrow foot-path. A careless step might
lead to a fall that would mean, I hardly
dare to say what!"</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy had been wishing to
join the party, but upon hearing this, they
lost all interest in it, and had cheerfully
taken the drive behind gentle Romeo, instead.
Now, as Dorothy sat with Nancy's
arms about her, she was glad that they had
not been permitted to go, and she heartily
wished that Floretta had remained at the
Cleverton.</p>

<p>"Had she rolled from the path, and
fallen, fallen,&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dorothy covered her eyes with her hands,
as if she almost saw the little girl falling,
down, down to the ravine so far below the
path, and was trying to shut out the picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Nancy, still striving to quiet her fear, heard
some one telling what the scribbled note
had said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dorothy!" she whispered, eagerly,
"Floretta is just where they know how to
find her, and they've promised to hurry,
and bring her back."</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure?</i>" Dorothy asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sure!</i>" said Nancy.</p>

<p>Then Nancy climbed into the big chair
beside her, and the two little girls sat, each
tightly clasping the other's hands, while
they waited and watched for the first
glimpse of the men who should return,
bringing Floretta with them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte remained
with Mrs. Paxton, who seemed to
have lost all control of herself.</p>

<p>One moment she would cry as if her
heart would break, and then she would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
spring up, threatening to follow the direction
that the men had taken, and try to
reach the woods, thus to sooner see her little
girl.</p>

<p>At last, after what seemed endless waiting,
but was actually only an hour, some
one espied the men in the distance, and
cried out:</p>

<p>"They're coming! They're coming!"</p>

<p>"Have they got Floretta? Oh, <i>have</i>
they found her?" shrieked Mrs. Paxton.</p>

<p>"We can't see from here," said the one
who had spoken, and the mother rushed
forward, shading her eyes with her hand,
and straining to catch the first glimpse of
her child.</p>

<p>She would have rushed down the road to
meet them, but Mrs. Dainty held her back.
She had seen that they were carrying Floretta,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and she thought, in case the child were
injured, the mother would far better save
her strength.</p>

<p>Two of the men had clasped their hands
to form an "arm-chair," and thus they
brought to the piazza, a very limp, tired
Floretta, whose vivacity was all gone, and
whose face bore the trace of desperate
weeping, while her arms and hands were
covered with cuts and bruises, and her
little frock was torn and tattered by her
struggle with the tough and tightly knotted
vines.</p>

<p>She lay back against the shoulder of one
man who supported her, and looked as if
her strength were spent.</p>

<p>She changed on the instant that they set
her on her feet.</p>

<p>Rushing to her mother, she permitted her
to clasp her for a moment to her breast, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
turning to the group that gathered around
her, she cried fiercely:</p>

<p>"Look! See my hands! See my arms!
See the scratches, where I tried to get
away, and it was Sidney Cumston who
tied me! He <i>did</i> it, but the other boys
<i>let</i> him. Not one tried to hinder him except
Jack Tiverton, the littlest one of them all.
He tried to make them let me go, but they
wouldn't. Oh, somebody punish all but
Jack! He <i>tried</i>, but he couldn't help me."</p>

<p>She was hysterical, and sank to the floor
of the piazza, sobbing, and crying, before
her mother could catch her.</p>

<p>She scrambled to her feet, and was
clasped in her mother's arms.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Cunningham surprised every one
by speaking most kindly to her. She had
so often tormented him that it seemed generous
that he should offer a bit of comfort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think we shall let those young
rascals escape without a sharp reprimand,
and if I was to venture a guess about it, I
should say that little Jack, after all, managed
to help you, Floretta," he said.</p>

<p>She turned in surprise to look at the old
face, that now looked so kindly at her.</p>

<p>"Come out here, Jack," said the old gentleman,
"didn't you write the note that
sent us searching for this little girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jack, "and I wrote it
'cause I thought the other big fellows were
mean, but if they find out I told, they'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, they won't," said Mr. Cunningham.
"You're no 'tell-tale.' You did just right,
and the men here will stand by you. Those
big boys were the cowards to torment a little
girl. You're the best boy up here in the
mountains."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for young Tiverton!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
shouted some one, and in the midst of the
excitement, Mrs. Paxton, with her little
daughter, slipped away to their room, after
having thanked little Jack for his valuable
assistance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Mr. Cunningham had been
searching in this pocket and that for something
which he seemed most anxious to
find.</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew I had it! Come here,
Jack!"</p>

<p>Blushing and diffident, Jack walked over
to the big rocker.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't much, boy, but I think you
ought to have a medal. Here's a silver dollar
I've been keeping for a pocket piece.
I'll give it to you for a medal, for being
brave enough to tell what you knew <i>ought</i>
to be told. That's not tale-bearing, and as
you were afraid to tell, for fear of those big<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
bullies, it was a brave act. You're a lad
that knows <i>what</i> to do, <i>when</i> to do, and then
<i>does</i> it!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Jack Tiverton!" some one
cried again, and this time they were given
with a will.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiverton, returning from a long
drive, wondered what all the excitement
meant, and why they were cheering her
little son.</p>

<p>Jack, with his silver dollar tightly
clasped, hung his head, and looked as if
overpowered by his conspicuous position.</p>

<p>Dorothy, now bright and happy, since
Floretta was safe, saw that Jack hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Tiverton," she said, "Jack
has been truly the <i>best</i> boy in the world,
but he can't speak just now. When he tells
you what he's done, you won't wonder why
they cheered him!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Barnet and Flossie, with Uncle
Harry and his wife, now arrived in their
big automobile from a three-days' trip that
they had been enjoying.</p>

<p>Of course Dorothy and Nancy tried to
tell Flossie all about Floretta and Jack, and
they were both so excited that Flossie got
a very twisted idea of the affair.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry, not dreaming that the matter
was at all serious, turned, after greeting
the children, to enter the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harry!" cried Flossie, "you
ought to hear about it. There were ever
so many big boys, and only one little girl,
and they tied her so she couldn't get away,
and Jack wrote a note, and when they
found her,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Flossie, dear, I'm perfectly willing
to be scared half out of my wits, but I
<i>must</i> know what I'm being scared about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
You're getting me so mixed up that I've
not the least idea what this is all about.
Have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Flossie, "I don't <i>half</i> understand
it, but it does sound so frightful,
that I'm so scared, I need to have you be
scared, too."</p>

<p>"Well, then," Uncle Harry replied, "if
it will help you to know it, I'll admit that
my teeth are chattering, and shivers are
running up and down my spine!</p>

<p>"I thought at first that it was the draft
across this piazza, but perhaps, after all, it
was caused by what you were telling me."</p>

<p>When, at last, he had heard the story, he
was full of disgust that any boy, and his
friends, should have been guilty of such a
contemptible act, and his sympathy for the
little girl was deep and sincere.</p>

<p>"She will need rest and quiet to-morrow,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he said, "and you three little friends
will be kind, I think, if you stay rather
closely here, and help, in some quiet way,
to amuse her."</p>

<p>"We will," said Dorothy, "I'll let her
read my new fairy book if she'd like to.
She could lie in the hammock, and do that."</p>

<p>"I'll keep the hammock swinging," said
Nancy.</p>

<p>"And I'll give her my new box of candy
I just brought home," said Flossie.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Uncle Harry, "and
for your sweet promises of kindness toward
the child who has suffered so much to-day
I'll remind you that on day after to-morrow
I shall give myself the pleasure of taking
you all to the fair. I promise you a <i>fine</i>
time."</p>

<p>He turned to look over his shoulder, and
laugh at their wild little cries of delight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>He was anticipating the pleasure quite as
much as they.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dorothy, Nancy, and Flossie kept the
promise that they had made, and Floretta
fully enjoyed their kindness. She seemed
unusually gentle, and Mrs. Paxton thanked
them for so sweetly helping to amuse her,
and thus make her willing to spend the day
quietly.</p>

<p>The day set for the visit to the village
fair dawned bright and sunny, a light breeze
making it just cool enough to be delightful.</p>

<p>The barge was waiting for its gay little
passengers.</p>

<p>The children stood with impatient feet on
the piazza, waiting for their host, merry,
handsome Uncle Harry.</p>

<p>At last a firm tread caused them to turn,
and there he was, looking gayer than ever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a picture of health, strength, and kindliness,
and clad in a most becoming outing
suit of light gray serge.</p>

<p>The blue of his tie was not bluer than his
fine eyes, and no one could have glanced at
him without knowing that he possessed a
generous, loving nature, a kind and merry
heart.</p>

<p>"Come, little friends!" he cried. "Is
every young lady that I invited here?" he
added, looking anxiously lest some child be
late, and thus by chance, be left behind.</p>

<p>"Every one is here!" said Flossie. "I
know because I've counted."</p>

<p>"Then we'll start at once, unless some
one would rather wait 'til to-morrow?" he
said, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! No!" they cried. "We just
<i>couldn't</i> wait!"</p>

<p>"In that case we'll go now!" he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with a droll expression, as if he started at
once, merely as an accommodation.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Harry! You're only joking,"
cried Flossie. "You wouldn't be
willing to wait until to-morrow. I heard
you tell Aunt Vera to hurry and find your
tie, because you were in such a rush to
start!"</p>

<p>"To think that my own little niece would
tell tales like that, and thus let out the
secret. What chance have I now, of making
them think that I was really very shy
about riding with such a large party of
girls?"</p>

<p>Shouts of laughter greeted this speech,
and Uncle Harry waited until it had subsided,
then he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if no one <i>believes</i> that I am
shy or diffident, it's waste of time to try to
appear so, so I shall not try. Instead, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
shall be very bold. Come, dears, let me help
you in!"</p>

<p>And amid shouts of laughter from the
children, he lifted each high in air, and
placed her in the barge, thus saving her the
trouble of mounting the steps.</p>

<p>Then taking his seat in the middle of the
laughing, chattering little party, he called
to the driver to start.</p>

<p>The long whip cracked, Jack Tiverton,
from the piazza, blew loudly on a tin
trumpet, and they were off over the road,
the happiest party that ever filled a barge.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry told some amusing stories,
then, led by his fine voice, they sang some
gay little songs, and before they dreamed
that they had arrived at the fair, the driver
shouted:</p>

<p>"Here we are!" and sure enough, they
had reached the fair grounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I didn't suppose we were more
than half-way here," said Dorothy, "and
the reason is that the ride has been so
jolly."</p>

<p>"That's just it," agreed Nancy.</p>

<p>"The reason <i>I</i> enjoyed the ride," said
Uncle Harry, "is because I was so charmed
with my little guests."</p>

<p>"And the reason why we had such a fine
ride," said Flossie, "is because we had the
<i>best</i> man in the world taking care of us."</p>

<p>Uncle Harry bowed low.</p>

<p>"This must be a wedding party, if I'm
the 'best man,'" he said with a laugh, "so
we'll not fuss because there's no musician
to play a march for us, but we'll play you
are all bridesmaids, and we'll hurry right
along. The entrance is this way, I think,
and under that evergreen arch."</p>

<p>A large tent had been pitched for the display<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the various wares and numerous
attractions; a smaller tent near it serving
as fortune teller's booth.</p>

<p>"We'll coax Uncle Harry to have his
fortune told," whispered Flossie to Dorothy,
when, to their great surprise, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Flossie, you little witch! Uncle
Harry heard what you said, and not only
is he going to have his fortune told, but he's
going to make every one of you little girls
have yours told, also!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AT THE FAIR</h3>

<div class='cap'>THE fair proved a great delight to the
children. They had all been to fine
fairs patronized by fashionable matrons,
whose names were quite enough to insure
success, but the country fair was an absolute
novelty.</div>

<p>At the large city fairs, merry d&eacute;butantes
graced the booths, and sold flowers, or tickets
for the various games of chance.</p>

<p>Here in the mountain village all was different,
and the novelty gave greater interest.</p>

<p>Farmers' daughters were in the booths,
and sold huge bouquets of old-fashioned
garden flowers, homemade candy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
honey, while one rosy-cheeked lass dispensed
sweet cider, or sweet apples, according
to the preference of her customer.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry purchased a huge stalk of
hollyhocks for each of his guests, but for
himself he chose an enormous sunflower
which he insisted looked <i>fine</i> in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>There was music, if it could be called
music, furnished by the local band.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry said he had never seen
such independent people as those musicians
were. He declared that the music sounded,
to him, as if each man commenced to play
when he chose, and stopped when he got
ready, regardless of what the other players
were doing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do believe that is the way they
play!" cried Dorothy, laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is," cried Uncle Harry,
"and a great deal of bother it saves, for no
one has to direct them; they do not know
that they are making discord, and thus they
play and play with all their might, and are
absolutely care-free and happy."</p>

<p>There were heaps of giant pumpkins,
and more red and yellow ears of corn than
they had ever seen before, while everywhere
was laughter, and friendly gossip,
and chatter, that made the fair a jolly place
in which to roam about.</p>

<p>The children were determined to see
every object in the big tent, and while some
were interested in one thing, others wished
to see something else, so they decided to
divide into two groups.</p>

<p>One half of the little party turned to the
right intent upon seeing some gaudy patchwork
quilts, while the others turned to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
left declaring their intention of investing
all their pennies in the "fish-pond."</p>

<p>There were so many things to see on the
way, that it was a long time before they
met, as they had agreed, at the entrance.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the way they had missed
Uncle Harry, and they could not imagine
where he had gone.</p>

<p>It happened that Uncle Harry had seen a
very small girl crying, and his first thought
was to help her, and thus dry her tears.</p>

<p>Upon questioning her, he found that the
wee little maid had, by accident, knocked
a small doll from one of the tables, and had
been roundly scolded.</p>

<p>"That pretty girl with the black eyes
says I did it a-purpose, but I didn't,"
she cried, "I wanted to see it, and
I just touched it, and it tumbled off the
table."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Her tears fell afresh, and in place of a
handkerchief, she drew up her blue-checked
apron, and hid her face in it.</p>

<p>"Look up, little girl," Uncle Harry said,
and his voice sounded so kindly, that she at
once peeped at him through her tears.</p>

<p>"Which is the table where all this happened?"</p>

<p>"That one," said the child, "and the big
girl is looking at me now."</p>

<p>"Then give me your hand, and, just for
fun, <i>we'll</i> go and look at <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>A moment she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, and with a sunny smile,
the little girl placed her hand in his, and
the big, handsome man with the wee country
lass approached the table together.</p>

<p>"I'll lift you up so you can see nicely,"
he said. "Now, which was the doll that fell
from the table?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the child could reply, the girl
spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"'Twas that one, sir, and her meddlesome
fingers,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," said Uncle
Harry, then turning to the child he said:</p>

<p>"Did you like that one best, or is that
larger one finer?"</p>

<p>"That large one is the loveliest. I didn't
<i>ever</i> see one so fine as that."</p>

<p>"We'll have that one, then," he said,
offering a bill to the astonished salesgirl.</p>

<p>"There, little girl, she's yours," he said,
as he placed the big doll in her arms.</p>

<p>"I can hold her a little while?" she
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"You can hold her <i>always</i>, if you want
to," he said gently, "I bought her for you."</p>

<p>Rapturously she clasped the gift in her
arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I love you, because you are good,"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Then tell me your name," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm Lois Ann Ferguson," chirped the
little girl, "and father is Sandy Ferguson.
Oh, there he is now. He's to play the
pipes."</p>

<p>She ran toward a sturdy man dressed in
Highland costume, and carrying the bagpipes
under his arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson glanced at her flushed
cheeks, saw the gorgeous doll that she flourished
before his astonished eyes, and finally
understood that the tall, handsome stranger
had bestowed it upon his wee daughter, as
a gift.</p>

<p>He took her little hand, and hurried forward,
saying:</p>

<p>"I dinna ken why he should dae it for
my wee lassie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wad gladly thank ye, sir," he said,
"but I'm lost in wonder that ye made wee
Lois sae blithe an' gay wi' the braw
gift."</p>

<p>"She's a dear little lass," said Uncle
Harry, "and when I found her crying, I
knew that a fine new doll would dry her
tears. Don't bother to thank me. I made
myself happy, when I comforted her."</p>

<p>"I wish there were mair like ye," said
Sandy Ferguson, "an' some day when ye're
older, an' ha' a wee daughter of yer ain,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have a wife and baby girl now," was
the quick reply, "and they are my dearest
possessions."</p>

<p>"An' I thought ye a braw, bonny laddie,
wi' yer fair hair an' blue een! Weel, weel,
ye dinna hae tae live 'til ye're auld before
ye ken tae dae a kindly act," Sandy Ferguson
replied, "an' later when I play the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pipes, an' Lois dances, she shall make her
first bow tae her new friend."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harry, <i>did</i> you buy the new
doll for the little girl?"</p>

<p>It was little Flossie, who, after having
searched every corner of the tent, had found
him talking to the Scotchman and his little
girl.</p>

<p>"Is he your own uncle?" little Lois
asked, looking up into Flossie's lovely face.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Flossie, "and he's the
best uncle in the world."</p>

<p>"I know he must be," said the little girl.
"See how good he was to me."</p>

<p>They turned to join the rest of their party,
and little Lois looked over her shoulder,
with one hand held fast in her father's,
while with the other she tightly clasped the
precious doll.</p>

<p>"I saw the notice near the entrance when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
we came in, that a Scotch farmer would
play, and his little daughter would dance,"
said Uncle Harry, "but that child is not
much more than a baby. She cannot be
more than four. It will be amusing to see
her dance, and Nancy Ferris will enjoy it
most of all."</p>

<p>They found the others reading the notice
of which they had been talking, and they
were delighted when they heard what a
very little girl it was who was to dance.</p>

<p>They had a lunch served by girls dressed
as dairy maids, and it was just such a lunch
as might have been enjoyed at a farmhouse.</p>

<p>The long table spread with its white
cloth, and set with blue and white dishes,
was decorated by a garland of small sunflowers
that lay upon the cloth, down
the centre, and the entire length of the
table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>There were plates heaped with biscuit,
there were dishes of both wild and cultivated
strawberries, and delicious cream to
be eaten with them, there were sandwiches
and little cakes, honey enough to tempt the
bees to the feast, and the children thought
it finer than a hotel dinner. How they
laughed, and chattered, as they enjoyed the
spread!</p>

<p>Uncle Harry was in his sunniest mood,
and told stories and jokes that kept them
amused, and seemed to be the gayest member
of the party.</p>

<p>"Tell us a story about when you were a
<i>little</i> boy," said Flossie.</p>

<p>"My small niece thinks I'm nothing but
a <i>big</i> boy now!" he said.</p>

<p>"Well, the big Scotchman thought you
were only a lad. I heard him say so," said
Flossie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you were a boy were you ever
naughty, <i>real</i> naughty?" Floretta asked.</p>

<p>She had been very quiet, and all were
surprised at her question.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, when I was little,"
said Uncle Harry, "I was very, <i>very</i> fond
of good things, but the one thing that I
liked better than anything else was strawberry
jam.</p>

<p>"I was always allowed to have it, but I
felt sure that it would taste even nicer if
I had more of it at a time, and still finer if
I could have a long handled spoon, and eat
it right from the jar.</p>

<p>"I used often to think how fine it would
be if I, some day, could have the chance to
eat it that way, but I never could get even
<i>very</i> near the jar.</p>

<p>"One day the opportunity came. My
sister and I were in the nursery, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
maid had been down-stairs for a long
time.</p>

<p>"The rest of the family were away, and
we were to have our tea in the nursery, as
usual, only, as we had had to remain at
home, we were to have an extra treat.</p>

<p>"Among other good things, we were to
have strawberry jam.</p>

<p>"My sister, that is Flossie's mamma,
was a little older than I, and she was always
trying to give me lessons in good
behavior.</p>

<p>"'Now, Harry,' she said, 'while nurse
is down-stairs, we might commence to set
our table.'</p>

<p>"'There isn't anything here to set it
with but the tablecloth and the jam,' I said,
'but you're a girl, so you know how to put
the cloth on, and I'll bring the jam.'"</p>

<p>"I guess Uncle Harry was so fond of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
jam, that he liked even to carry the jar,"
said Flossie.</p>

<p>"We wondered why the nurse stayed so
long down-stairs," continued Uncle Harry,
"and I told my sister that I was tired of
waiting for tea, and I said I'd taste of the
jam, if only I had a long handled spoon.</p>

<p>"'Why, Harry,' she answered in disgust,
'I wouldn't think you'd be so
naughty, but,&mdash;if you really <i>want</i> to taste
it, here's the spoon beside the jar.'"</p>

<p>"And <i>did</i> you?" questioned Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I have to admit that I did.
In truth, I tasted and tasted until my sister
cried:</p>

<p>"'Why, Harry, you naughty boy! When
you get done tasting, there won't be any
left!'</p>

<p>"'You won't care, because <i>you</i> wouldn't
be so naughty as to taste it!' I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, wouldn't I?' she cried. 'Well,
you just let me take that spoon, and you'll
see!'</p>

<p>"Well, a funny mix-up followed, in which
we each tried to get possession of the spoon
and the jam. We were laughing while we
struggled for it, but at last, one of us
slipped, and fell, dragging the other down;
the jar of jam tipped over, and her white
frock, my gray jacket and trousers, and
even my long, yellow curls became smeared
with the jam.</p>

<p>"Nurse opened the door, and screamed
with terror, for the red jam looked as if
we had been terribly hurt, and it was some
time before we could convince her that we
were not cut or bruised, but only <i>very
sticky!</i></p>

<p>"Then came the scolding, and my sister
tried to screen me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Harry couldn't help tasting it, he's
so fond of jam,' she said.</p>

<p>"'Well, he's got a good share of it, inside
and out,' said nurse, grimly.</p>

<p>"'She's got as much as I have,' I said,
'just look at her frock!'</p>

<p>"Of course our clothes were changed,
and the jam cleaned from the polished floor,
but we had our tea without jam.</p>

<p>"Nurse said we could eat our biscuits
with the <i>memory</i> of the jam we had already
enjoyed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harry," cried Flossie, "I
wish, even though you were naughty, she'd
let you have more jam. She didn't know
how good you'd be when you grew up."</p>

<p>"I still am fond of jam!" he said, and
the children laughed to see him pour honey
over his berries that already were covered
with sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"You like <i>anything</i> that's sweet!" said
Dorothy, "whether it's jam, or sugar, or
honey,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or little girls," said Uncle Harry.
"You notice, I made this party all little
girls, and I'm having a <i>lovely</i> time."</p>

<p>"So are we," laughed Dorothy.</p>

<p>"And he says 'lovely' just as we do,"
said Nancy, "he does it to make us laugh."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you laugh?" said
Uncle Harry, and they <i>did</i> laugh, every
member of the party, and laughed because
they could not help it.</p>

<p>And when the merry feast was over, they
hastened to the small tent where the old
gypsy was telling fortunes.</p>

<p>Each had intended to have her fortune
told, and thus learn what the future held
for her.</p>

<p>To their great surprise, she flatly refused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to tell any child's fortune, saying that she
would only foretell events for "grown
ups." The little girls were rather afraid
of her, but Uncle Harry boldly offered his
hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Am I big enough to hear my fortune?"</p>

<p>"No nonsense, young lad," she said,
while the children dared not laugh. She
bent over his palm for a moment, then she
solemnly said:</p>

<p>"You're a brave lad, and you need to
be for you will fall in love with a girl who'll
have red hair, and the temper that usually
goes with it."</p>

<p>"O dear!" sighed Uncle Harry.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, young man," said the old
gypsy, "because it will be some months
before you marry."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Uncle Harry, "and what
shall I do if the girl proves to have the temper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
you prophesy? Shall I try to calm her
by holding her under a pump, or would you
advise tying her until she feels less fiery?"</p>

<p>"Young man, this is no laughing matter,"
was the sharp reply.</p>

<p>"Guess it isn't!" said Uncle Harry.
"I've seldom been so discouraged. Here
am I, a man who has a lovely wife and baby
girl, and yet I've got to marry a red-haired
girl, with a temper like chain lightning!
Who was ever in a worse fix?"</p>

<p>The old gypsy flew into a rage. "You're
poking fun at me!" she cried.</p>

<p>"There! There! The fun was worth
that!" he cried, laying a handful of small
coins on the table before her.</p>

<p>In her eagerness to count the money, she
forgot her wrath, and they hastened from
the tent, where, safely outside, they were
free to laugh as much as they chose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>As they re-entered the large tent, they
saw that near the centre, a space had been
cleared, and there was a crowd of people
waiting, as if expecting some attraction to
be exhibited.</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for almost
immediately the Scotch piper appeared,
and tightly clasping her precious new doll
in her arms was wee Lois, dressed in Highland
costume.</p>

<p>Placing her doll on a table, and making
sure that it was safe, she ran forward, courtesied
first to Uncle Harry, as she had
promised, and then, to the music of the
pipes, the wee lassie did the "Highland
Fling."</p>

<p>She was such a round, dimpled little girl,
one would never have dreamed that she
could dance with such infantile grace.</p>

<p>And when she had finished, with another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
courtesy, they crowded around her, and it
was Nancy who most generously praised
her. Dear little Nancy, who danced like a
fairy, never had a jealous thought in her
loving heart!</p>

<p>It was Uncle Harry who caught little
Lois, and lifted her so that he could look
into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I want my dolly, now," she cried, anxious
lest it be lost or stolen. Dorothy
brought the doll, and the child clasped it
to her breast.</p>

<p>"My wee lassie said she wisht she had a
gift tae gi' ye," said Sandy.</p>

<p>"I have a dear little girl of my own, and
I prize her baby kisses," said Uncle Harry.
"Will <i>you</i> give me one, little Lois?"</p>

<p>She clasped her arms around his neck,
and kissed him softly.</p>

<p>"Best man next to father," she said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>FLOSSIE'S LETTER</h3>

<div class='cap'>THE children said "good-by" to little
Lois, and as her father carried her
away, she waved her hand to them.</div>

<p>"Wasn't she cunning?" said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"She was very sweet," said Nancy,
"and how well she did her little
dance!"</p>

<p>"She didn't dance half as fine as you do,
Nancy Ferris," said Floretta. "You <i>know</i>
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I was trained for dancing,"
said Nancy, "and, beside, she was very little
to dance so cleverly."</p>

<p>Floretta made no reply, but she thought
of what Nancy had said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trained for dancing. She said she was
<i>trained</i> to dance. I wonder where? I
wish I knew, but I didn't quite dare to
ask her."</p>

<p>Once more they walked around the big
tent, and Uncle Harry purchased a gift for
each to carry home as a souvenir.</p>

<p>There were little baskets that the gypsies
had woven, and fancy boxes filled with
woodland plants. The boxes were made
from birch bark, and were very dainty.</p>

<p>These the children prized, and lovingly
they thanked him for the pretty gifts.</p>

<p>At the candy table he purchased enough
of the homemade bonbons to fill the baskets,
and then they left the tent to start
on the homeward trip.</p>

<p>The barge was waiting for them, and
they clambered in, tired, but very happy.</p>

<p>"This is the nicest fair I ever went to,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
said Dorothy, "and I've had so many good
things that I'm going to save my basket of
candy until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So am I," cried all the others.</p>

<p>"And so am <i>I</i>," said Uncle Harry, as he
held up a huge basket filled with all kinds
of candy.</p>

<p>How they laughed, and accused him of
having a "sweet-tooth."</p>

<p>"Now, just a moment!" he cried, as he
held up his finger for silence, "I'm taking
this <i>big</i> basket home to treat the <i>big</i> ladies
with. I took the <i>little</i> ladies with me, but
I've not forgotten the <i>big</i> ladies that I left
at the hotel."</p>

<p>"Because you don't ever forget any
one," said Flossie, and the others cried:</p>

<p>"That's it! Just it! He does nice things
for every one."</p>

<p>"Oh, spare my blushes," said Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Harry, but it was easy to see that their
affection for him pleased him.</p>

<p>The ride home seemed shorter than the
trip to the fair.</p>

<p>They joined in singing the merry songs
that his fine voice led, and the horses, knowing
that they were on the homeward trip,
jogged along at a better pace than when
they had started out.</p>

<p>Uncle Harry had found some bells, and
fastened them to their harnesses, and they
made a jingling accompaniment to the
merry voices.</p>

<p>And when the barge drew up at the Cleverton,
Uncle Harry, with elaborate courtesy,
handed each young lady down, bowing
low, and thanking her for the honor she
had conferred upon him by permitting him
to take her to the fair.</p>

<p>"Oh, you do truly know we have to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thank you for giving us such a lovely day!"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"But think how happy I have been,"
he said, and although his blue eyes
were laughing, they knew that he meant
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, we had the finest time,"
cried Dorothy, "and see the fine basket of
candy and the pretty birch bark box! See
the little ferns growing in it. Isn't he
<i>dear?</i>"</p>

<p>"He surely is charming," said Mrs.
Dainty. "His generous, sunny nature
makes every one love him, and I believe
he values the love of his friends more than
most things."</p>

<p>"He has been gay, and full of fun all
day," said Nancy, "and it will take a long
time to tell you all the pleasant things he
did for us. I do wish you and Aunt Charlotte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<i>could</i> have been there when he had his
fortune told."</p>

<p>"And he couldn't have been any nicer to
us if we'd been tall ladies," said Floretta.</p>

<p>"I hope every one of you little friends
were real <i>little ladies</i>, thus rewarding him
for his kindness," Aunt Charlotte said,
gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, we were," said Nancy, "not a single
one of us did anything that could
trouble him."</p>

<p>"There were a number of little girls who
only came here last week, so we weren't
much acquainted with them, but they were
all very nice, and he said he had as fine a
time as we did," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>She climbed into a large hammock, and
with Nancy beside her, sat swinging, and
thinking of the day that had been so delightfully
spent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton came out upon the piazza,
and, instead of sitting down, seemed to be
looking for something.</p>

<p>"Can I help you?" said Nancy, slipping
from the hammock, and hastening toward
her.</p>

<p>"I've mislaid my glasses," she said,
"and I can't find them."</p>

<p>She did not thank Nancy for so kindly
offering to help her, but Nancy seemed not
to notice that. She peeped under chairs,
lifted their cushions, and even looked between
folds of newspapers that lay near at
hand, but the glasses were not in sight.</p>

<p>"How trying!" said Mrs. Fenton, "I
have some letters that I wish to read, and
I can't read them until my glasses are
found."</p>

<p>"Did you use them anywhere but just
here?" Nancy asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton stood for a moment thinking.</p>

<p>"Seems to me I <i>did</i> have them in the
dining-room," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll go and ask the waitresses if they
have seen them," said Nancy, as she ran
toward the hall.</p>

<p>She paused in the doorway, amazed at
what she saw.</p>

<p>Floretta, with a pair of eyeglasses upon
her small nose, was walking up and down
the room, as nearly as possible, in Mrs.
Fenton's manner, and exactly imitating her
voice, while a group of waitresses, the cook,
and two kitchen maids laughed, and applauded
her.</p>

<p>She cared not who composed her audience,
so long as she obtained applause.
Floretta was, evidently, quite herself once
more!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Floretta!" cried Nancy, "you
mustn't, truly you mustn't. Give me the
glasses. Mrs. Fenton is looking everywhere
for them!"</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't give them to you!" said
Floretta, rudely. "You aren't Mrs. Fenton."</p>

<p>"But I've been helping her to hunt for
them. She has some letters she wants to
read, and she can't till she has her glasses,"
insisted Nancy.</p>

<p>"Then let her come for them!" cried
Floretta, when a quiet voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Very well, I <i>have</i> come for them," it
said, and there in the doorway stood Mrs.
Fenton.</p>

<p>The silly maids who had laughed so
loudly, now hastily disappeared in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Floretta dropped the glasses upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
table, and then, wholly ashamed, crawled
under it, where Mrs. Fenton's sharp eyes
might not look at her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton took the glasses, and without
another word, swept from the room.</p>

<p>Nancy, waiting in the hall, crept softly
toward her, and gently laid her hand on the
lady's arm.</p>

<p>"I'm <i>so</i> sorry she did that. I wish I
could have got the glasses from her, and
brought them to you before you came to
find them. Then you needn't have known
how naughty,&mdash;" Nancy caught her breath.</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Nancy. Remember,
as <i>I</i> shall, that <i>you</i> were not the naughty,
disgusting child," said Mrs. Fenton, and
she turned, with her letters and glasses in
her hand, and went up the long stairway to
her room.</p>

<p>It was nearly time to dress for dinner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
which was always served promptly at
six.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty with Dorothy, and Aunt
Charlotte with Nancy hastened to their
rooms, to freshen their toilettes, and Nancy
realized that there would not be time to tell
Aunt Charlotte all about the unpleasant
happening.</p>

<p>"I've something to tell you, but I'll have
to wait till we've plenty of time," she
said.</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte, tying the soft, blue ribbon
into the brown curls, looked into the
mirror before which they were standing,
and smiled at the thoughtful face.</p>

<p>"Will it keep until then, dear?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Nancy, "I only tell it
to you because I love to tell you everything."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear child," said Aunt Charlotte, "I
bless the day that you, as a little waif, were
taken in by Mrs. Dainty, and that I was
asked to come and care for you. I could
not love you more if you were my own little
girl."</p>

<p>"I never saw my own mamma; she died
when I was a baby," said Nancy, "so, because
you love me, you seem like my very
own."</p>

<p>Gentle Aunt Charlotte's eyes were wet
with happy tears, as she hooked the pretty,
white muslin frock, with its slip of light
blue, and tied the soft blue belt.</p>

<p>"Your shoes must be changed, Nancy,"
she said. "You know how particular
Mrs. Dainty is about the matter of shoes
and stockings. They must match the
frock."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Nancy, "and with this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
one she said: 'Wear blue stockings and
bronze slippers,' so I will."</p>

<p>She found the blue hose and the pretty
bronze slippers, then, with elfin grace, she
caught the edge of her skirt, and with rosy,
bare feet, tripped across the floor in a graceful,
gliding step, crying:</p>

<p>"Look, Aunt Charlotte, look! This
pretty step Bonfanti taught me."</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte did look, and as she
watched the pretty child, and saw her joy
in dancing, she marvelled that little Nancy
could smile as she danced, remembering all
that she had been taught, while apparently
forgetting all the unhappy months upon the
stage.</p>

<p>She thought of poor little Nancy, forced
to dance, night after night, to support her
old Uncle Steve, who was too lazy to support
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>She thought of the time that the little
pitiful note from Nancy had reached them,
and, together, she and Mrs. Dainty had
found the child, and brought her safely
home.</p>

<p>She did not speak of all this. Nancy's
happy little heart should never be reminded
of sad days that were past.</p>

<p>Now her life was filled with bright sunshine,
the sunshine of love, and it was reflected
in her happy face.</p>

<p>A gong rang out a silvery note.</p>

<p>"Oh, my shoes!" cried Nancy, with a
peal of merry laughter. "I wanted to
show you those pretty steps, and I forgot
all about dinner."</p>

<p>It was the work of but a few seconds for
Nancy to draw on the light blue hose, and
even less time to put on the pretty slippers.
She ran to the mirror, and courtesied, took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a few tripping steps, smiling at her reflection,
and then hastened to the hall to join
Dorothy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<span class="caption">She took a few tripping steps, smiling at her reflection.&mdash;<a href="#Page_176"><i>Page 176.</i></a></span>
</div>

<p>"All ready," cried Nancy, springing to
her feet, to follow Dorothy.</p>

<p>A pretty pair they made as with arms
about each other's waist, they tripped along
the hall.</p>

<p>Fair, blue-eyed Dorothy Dainty was very
lovely in a pale pink frock with soft frillings
of fine lace. Her stockings were of the
same shade, and her shoes were white.
Mrs. Dainty in dark blue satin, and Aunt
Charlotte in pearl color made, with the two
children, a pleasing group.</p>

<p>In the lower hall they met Mrs. Paxton
with Floretta, the former wearing a gown
of purple satin, while Floretta wore a frock
of scarlet silk. Mrs. Fenton, passing, on
her way to the dining-room, looked sharply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
at the two groups, and <i>did</i> she look amused
when her eyes rested upon Mrs. Paxton,
and her small daughter? Dorothy noticed
the look, and turned to her mamma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty read the question in Dorothy's
eyes, and ever so slightly, shook
her head, and they passed into the dining-room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The next morning, when the mail was
distributed, there was great excitement, because
every one had so many letters.</p>

<p>"See mine!" cried Flossie Barnet.
"Everybody see mine! It looks like boy's
writing. See it!"</p>

<p>"If some very young man wrote it, he
might not be delighted to have it so freely
exhibited, Flossie," said Uncle Harry, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, why should he care?" she asked in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
surprise. "Who do you s'pose wrote it?
Guess, Uncle Harry!"</p>

<p>"Well, now let me think," said Uncle
Harry, covering his eyes with his hand, then
peeping through his fingers.</p>

<p>"There's a small boy at home, who glories
in the name of Reginald Merton Deane.
Open the letter, dear, and if I guessed right,
you can give me a prize, and if I'm wrong,
I'll give you one."</p>

<p>Flossie studied the address for a moment,
then she opened the letter, and laughed
with delight.</p>

<p>"I'll have to give you the prize, but why
did he think to write to me?"</p>

<p>Dear little Flossie had never seemed
aware that small Reginald preferred her to
any of his friends. Even when she was so
little that she could not pronounce his
name, and called him "Weginald," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
thought her the dearest of all his playmates.
And this was his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Flossie:</span></p>

<p>"I miss you so much that I'm going to
write, and tell you all the news.</p>

<p>"Our old dog had a fit yesterday, and my
brother got the vet'nary doctor. When he
came, he said Carlo hadn't any fit. He was
acting just awful. I said 'what makes him
tare round so?' an he said maybe I'd tare
round sum if I had a fish-bone in my throat!
The doctor took it out, and then Carlo was
so glad he tore round worsen ever!</p>

<p>"Arabella Corryville is acting worse
than Carlo did. You know her Aunt Matilda
lives with them, an neether Arabella, or her
pa, or her ma dare to do ennything without
asking Aunt Matilda <i>first</i>. Well, her aunt
has had to go way up to New Hampshur (I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
guess I didn't spell that rite) and Arabella
thinks its just her chanse to act awful.
Carlo is real quiet side of Arabella when
she acts the way she does now.</p>

<p>"She stays out doors most all the time,
and goes just where she pleases.</p>

<p>"Some days she's way down by the stashun
until its almost dark.</p>

<p>"You know she's always taking medesin,
and carries the bottles in her pockets.</p>

<p>"She carries em now, but she told me
she's takin the kind she likes best. Theres
two kinds her Aunt Matilda made her take,
one tasted horrid, and the other tasted nice.
Arabella threw the horrid one away, and
ate the nice pills for candy. She told me
this morning that her Aunt Matilda is coming
home just for one day, and then they're
all going up where you, and Dorothy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Nancy are. I don't believe it, but if she
does, and you see her, you needn't give my
love to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A GIFT OF WILDFLOWERS</h3>

<div class='cap'>OF course, Dorothy and Nancy were
greatly interested in the letter, and
Uncle Harry said that he was glad that
Reginald had thought to say that the fish-bone
had been removed from Carlo's throat.</div>

<p>He said it would have seemed quite a trip
to take to leave the Cleverton, and go to
Merrivale to feel Carlo's pulse, and inquire
for his health.</p>

<p>"Now that that bone is removed, I
breathe easier," said Uncle Harry, "and
so does Carlo!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't have gone home just
to call on Carlo," said Flossie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," he said, trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
look solemn, "I wouldn't like Carlo to feel
neglected, and now I think of it, does Reginald
speak of the cat?"</p>

<p>"No," said Flossie, "but when I answer
the letter, I'll tell Reginald you're anxious
about her."</p>

<p>"I am," said Uncle Harry, "because the
last time I saw her, Carlo was barking at
her very rudely, and her back was up in
a hump like a camel's. Reginald ought to
have told us if her back is <i>still</i> up, or
whether she has taken the kink out of her
spine. We might telephone and ask, instead
of worrying."</p>

<p>He rose, and walked toward the hall,
whistling as he went, an old nursery song
that he used to sing to Flossie.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The cat came fiddling out of the barn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a pair of bagpipes under her arm."</span><br />
</div>

<p>How the children laughed!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look!" said Flossie, "he's going
right toward the telephone, just to
make us think that he's <i>truly</i> going to
ring up Reginald, and inquire for the
cat."</p>

<p>"Who is Arabella?" Floretta asked.</p>

<p>"She lives near us," said Dorothy, "and
she used to go to Aunt Charlotte's private
school with us."</p>

<p>"Doesn't she now?" asked Floretta.</p>

<p>"No, she left our class, and went to a
large school in the city."</p>

<p>"By what the letter says, I'd think she
was rather queer," said Floretta.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Dorothy, hesitating,
"Arabella <i>is</i> queer."</p>

<p>"Why don't you like to say so?" was
the sharp reply.</p>

<p>"Because Dorothy never likes to say
anything that isn't kind about any one, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Arabella <i>is</i> queer, so Dorothy won't say she
isn't," said Nancy.</p>

<p>It was a few days later that Dorothy was
reminded of what Reginald had said in his
letter to Flossie.</p>

<p>She was waiting for Nancy to go for a
walk, and stooping to pick some of the
pretty wildflowers that blossomed everywhere.</p>

<p>She had walked slowly along toward the
clump of white birches where, when they
had first arrived, they had called, and listened
to the echo.</p>

<p>She looked back toward the hotel, but
Nancy was not yet in sight, so she seated
herself upon the grass, and began to arrange
the flowers in a fine bouquet.</p>

<p>She was trying to mix the white blossoms
and pink buds so as to show the beauty
of each, when a carriage passed, and before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
she looked up a shrill little voice
shouted:</p>

<p>"Dorothy! Dorothy! We're over at the
farmhouse just beyond the Merlington.
Aunt Matilda wouldn't <i>let</i> pa take us to
a hotel. She doesn't approve of hotels.
Aunt Matilda says,&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was looking back to shout at Dorothy,
and doubtless would have given even
more particulars, but a firm hand had hastily
forced her to turn around, and sit
down.</p>

<p>Nancy ran along the path a few moments
later, and her eyes were dancing.</p>

<p>"Did you see Arabella?" she asked.
"<i>Did</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just a few moments ago, and she
turned around in the carriage and screamed
to me," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I can guess what she said," laughed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Nancy, "because she screamed at me. She
told me she was staying at a farmhouse,
and said that her Aunt Matilda didn't approve
of hotels."</p>

<p>"That is <i>just</i> what she said," said
Dorothy, "and she would have said
more but some one, I think it was her
Aunt Matilda, pulled her back into the
carriage."</p>

<p>"Why, that's just the way it was when
I saw her. I ran out on to the piazza, and
down the steps, and the carriage rolled by,
and she twisted round to shout. There was
this difference, though," said Nancy. "You
were out here alone, and no one would know
if you laughed, but when I ran out, our
piazza was full of people, and when Arabella
shouted, you'd ought to have seen
them look.</p>

<p>"Flossie and her Uncle Harry were on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the lawn, and as she rode past, he said with
a sigh:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Arabella, Arabella,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If I had my new umbrella,'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and I was wild to know the rest of it, but
his wife, who was standing near him,
said:</div>

<p>"'Hush, Harry, really you mustn't,' and
he only laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"'Oh, <i>mustn't</i> I? Why, when I saw
Arabella and her Aunt Matilda, I really felt
as if I <i>must!</i>'"</p>

<p>"Let's ask him what the rest of the verse
is," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I'm wild to hear it," Nancy said, "because
the very way he looked made me
think that the other lines, whatever they
were, would be funny."</p>

<p>She stooped to gather more of the little
blossoms to add to Dorothy's bouquet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
then commenced to make a bouquet of her
own.</p>

<p>"Arabella will be coming over to see
you," she said, a moment later, "and I
wonder if it is naughty to say, 'I wish she
wouldn't?' Do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Dorothy, "but I
<i>do</i> wish it. I wouldn't, only she is so
hard to please. Mamma wishes us to be
nice to every one, but, Nancy, you <i>do</i>
know that when we try the hardest to
please Arabella, we don't please her at
all."</p>

<p>"I know it," agreed Nancy, "but perhaps
she'll come some time when we are
out, and then we won't have to amuse
her."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I ought not to say it, but I
<i>do</i> wish it would happen that way," said
Dorothy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the birches, and they
paused to wake the echo. What fun it was
to hear their shouts repeated.</p>

<p>Again and again they called, and then a
droll thing happened. They had called this
name and that, and each time the echo,
like a voice from the mountain, had repeated
it with wonderful distinctness.
Then Dorothy, leaning forward, called,
loudly:</p>

<p>"Dorothy!"</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" came the reply.</p>

<p>She turned, and looked at Nancy. "Dorothy!"
she cried, again.</p>

<p>"<i>Dainty!</i>" was the answer, and upon
looking toward a little path that was nearly
opposite where they were standing, they
saw the low bushes move, and faintly they
heard a smothered laugh.</p>

<p>Dorothy was laughing now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys!" she cried, and back came the
laughing echo:</p>

<p>"<i>Girls!</i>" and then the boys peeped out
a bit too far, and Dorothy saw who had
been playing echo.</p>

<p>It was Jack Tiverton and a boy whom he
had chosen for a "chum." Jack had not
intended so soon to be discovered, and he
and his friend disappeared in a little grove,
while Dorothy and Nancy continued their
walk.</p>

<p>There were sunny paths and bits of woodland
that were so near the hotel as to be
absolutely safe, where all the summer
guests, especially the children, loved to
roam at will. Along one of these little
paths were sweet little yellow blossoms,
and these they gathered to brighten their
bouquets.</p>

<p>"Let's have some of these little vines to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hang from our bouquets," said Dorothy,
and the graceful vines proved to be an
added beauty.</p>

<p>When they returned to the Cleverton
there were but few people upon the piazza.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty and Aunt Charlotte sat talking
with Mrs. Vinton, and farther along,
Mrs. Fenton sat with an open book upon her
lap, although she was not reading.</p>

<p>She often had a book or magazine, but
rarely did she read them.</p>

<p>She would sit looking off at the distant
mountain-range, the white clouds, or the
sunny valley over which those clouds cast
floating shadows.</p>

<p>Did she hear the conversation, or notice
what was going on about her? Floretta
Paxton said that Mrs. Fenton acted as if
she sat there to watch some one; and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Floretta right? Mrs. Fenton's actions certainly
seemed strange day after day. She
talked little, took slight interest in what
was going on about her, and was a mystery
to all the other guests.</p>

<p>But what, or whom could she be watching?</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy, returning from their
walk, saw the group, and also noticed Mrs.
Fenton, who always chose to sit apart from
the others.</p>

<p>"I'll give my flowers to mamma and Mrs.
Vinton," said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"And I'll give mine to Aunt Charlotte
and to Mrs. Fenton,&mdash;if she wants them,"
said Nancy, hesitating because it was so
hard to guess what might, or might not,
please Mrs. Fenton.</p>

<p>Dorothy ran to show her blossoms to her
mamma and to Mrs. Vinton, while Nancy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
pausing beside Mrs. Fenton's chair, held
forth her pretty bouquet, as she said:</p>

<p>"We've just gathered them. Aren't they
pretty?"</p>

<p>"Lovely, very lovely," said Mrs. Fenton,
with more interest than usual. "I remember
picking just such flowers; even the long
vines I know are like those I used to see
when I was a little girl."</p>

<p>"Would you enjoy some of these? I'd
so like to give them to you," Nancy said,
and she was surprised at the quick reply.</p>

<p>"I would really prize them, Nancy, and
you're a sweet child to give them to me,"
she said.</p>

<p>Quickly Nancy divided the bouquet, and
smiled as she laid the pretty things in Mrs.
Fenton's lap.</p>

<p>"I cannot let them wilt, so I will take
them at once to my room," said Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Fenton, and Nancy saw her bend to catch
their perfume, as she turned toward the
hall.</p>

<p>That night, when nearly all the guests had
entered the dining-room, Mrs. Fenton came
in at the main entrance, and as she sat
nearly opposite Mrs. Dainty's party, they
noticed that the bodice of her black lace
gown was given color by the pretty wildflowers
that Nancy had given her. They
were the first flowers that she had worn
since her arrival.</p>

<p>Nancy smiled with pleasure, and Mrs.
Fenton, looking across the table, returned
the smile.</p>

<p>Had the gift of simple wildflowers cheered
her?</p>

<p>Thus far she had worn only black, but to-night
a dull gold slip shimmered through
the black lace; and were her eyes brighter?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Nancy thought so, and without knowing
why, was glad.</p>

<p>There was a musicale in the evening, and
Mrs. Fenton joined Mrs. Dainty and Aunt
Charlotte, and seemed to enjoy the conversation,
between the numbers of the program.</p>

<p>Once, while she was talking, she laid her
hand lightly upon Nancy's shoulder, and
Nancy looked up to smile. Aunt Charlotte
saw that the lady was more cheerful, and
also noticed that she wore Nancy's flowers.
The evening passed pleasantly, and Nancy's
drowsy words, just before she went to sleep,
were:</p>

<p>"I do really think I cheered her."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A few days later Mrs. Dainty invited Mrs.
Fenton to be her guest during a drive over
a lovely road that neither of them had yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
seen. It was said to be one of the most picturesque
roads in that section of the country.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fenton accepted, and with Aunt
Charlotte and Mrs. Vinton they formed a
pleasant party.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy were to drive in their
little phaeton, and they felt quite as important
as the four ladies in the barouche.</p>

<p>True, Mrs. Dainty owned a handsome
span of bays, but was not the pony, Romeo,
a beauty?</p>

<p>The road was some distance from the
Cleverton, and there were some charming
places to be seen on the way, so it happened
that the trip, which proved to be most enjoyable,
occupied the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton had a number of letters to
write, and Floretta, feeling very lonely, and
wishing that she had some one to play with,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
climbed into a hammock, and wondered
what she might do to amuse herself.</p>

<p>"Every one but me has gone somewhere,
and I wish <i>I</i> had," she said, as she
gave a smart kick that sent the hammock
higher.</p>

<p>"What's the fun of swinging alone?" she
grumbled, but there was no one on the piazza
to answer her, and she let the hammock
sway lazily while she looked down the sunny
road, and thought how strange it was that
the place seemed so still.</p>

<p>Not a leaf stirred, and Floretta's disgust
increased.</p>

<p>"Nothing in sight, not even an old hen,"
she said, when, way down where the road
looked so narrow and distant, a little figure
appeared, coming directly toward the Cleverton.
She watched the approaching figure,
and wondered who it might be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tisn't any one I know," she thought,
"and <i>doesn't</i> she look queer?"</p>

<p>Any one who had ever known Arabella
Corryville would also have known that she
always looked decidedly odd and strange,
and it was Arabella who was marching
steadily along the road.</p>

<p>So determined was her tread that one
might have thought that there was a band
behind her playing martial music to which
she was obliged to keep step.</p>

<p>"Well, whoever she is, she's carrying an
umbrella, this pleasant day," murmured
Floretta; then as she came near, she
added:</p>

<p>"And wearing rubbers and a raincoat,
as true as I live!"</p>

<p>Arabella was more bundled and wrapped
than at first appeared, for, as she came up
the gravel walk, Floretta saw that a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
veil was closely tied over her hat, and wound
about her throat.</p>

<p>From her appearance one might have
thought that she expected freezing weather
before night.</p>

<p>She walked up on to the piazza, and then
stood, for a moment, looking about, as if in
search of some one.</p>

<p>It was not politeness that prompted Floretta
to speak. It was simply curiosity. She
was wild to know who the strange-looking
child was, and whom she wished to see.</p>

<p>"Are you looking for some one?" she
asked, at the same time slipping from the
hammock, and going so close to Arabella
that she could peep into the queer little face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ARABELLA MAKES A CALL</h3>

<div class='cap'>ARABELLA peered at Floretta through
her spectacles, and was tempted not
to reply, but after a moment's pause she
changed her mind.</div>

<p>"I came to see Dorothy Dainty, and
Nancy Ferris," she said.</p>

<p>"They're out driving," said Floretta.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Arabella asked,
rudely.</p>

<p>"Because I heard them say they were
going, and because I saw them go," was the
quick reply.</p>

<p>"It's a long way over here, and now I've
got to take the same walk back," said Arabella.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're going to be out all the afternoon,"
said Floretta, "but why don't you
sit down, and rest a while before you go
back?"</p>

<p>It sounded kind, and Arabella at once
seated herself, while Floretta sat near
her.</p>

<p>She thought it would be great fun to question
this odd child, and there was no one
near to check her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you nearly roasted in that raincoat?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not chilly," said Arabella,
fixing her sharp eyes upon the other little
girl.</p>

<p>"Did you think it was going to rain?"
was the next question. "You've rubbers,
and umbrella."</p>

<p>Floretta barely managed to hide the fact
that she wanted to laugh. Her question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
seemed so absurd with the blue sky overhead,
and the sunshine everywhere.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to wear them," said Arabella,
"and I told Aunt Matilda it was too
pleasant to rain, but she said you never could
tell, and she said, too, that I could wear
them, or stay at home, so what could I
do?"</p>

<p>"<i>I'd</i> have stayed at home," said Floretta,
bluntly. "I wouldn't wear raincoat and
rubbers, and lug an umbrella for any Aunt
Matilda or Aunt Jemima!"</p>

<p>"Who is Aunt Jemima?" Arabella asked,
stupidly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Floretta, sharply,
"but then, I don't know your Aunt Matilda."</p>

<p>She longed to say that she did not want
to, but for once she did not quite dare to say
what she thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was an awkward pause. Floretta
could not think what to say next, while
Arabella did not try.</p>

<p>Silence never made her uneasy. She
could stare at any one who sat opposite her,
for a half-hour, without so much as winking,
and it rather amused her if the other person
became nervous, and wriggled uneasily beneath
her persistent stare. At last Floretta
spoke.</p>

<p>"You might take some of those things
off," she said; "you won't need them while
you stay."</p>

<p>"Aunt Matilda told me not to," said Arabella,
"and if I <i>did</i>, it would be just my
luck to have her come right by here, and
see me with them off. My! <i>Wouldn't</i> she
be angry?"</p>

<p>Arabella's eyes dilated as she asked the
question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does your Aunt Matilda poke 'round
after you like that?" asked Floretta.</p>

<p>"She doesn't ever <i>seem</i> to follow me, but
all the same, she's always catching me doing
something."</p>

<p>"Then you <i>do</i> risk doing what she tells
you not to," said Floretta, with a saucy
laugh.</p>

<p>"Look here!" cried Arabella, "I don't
know you, but I'm going to tell you something.
I can't do one single thing I want
to, neither can my papa or mamma. Aunt
Matilda is little, and my papa is big. He
says he was centre-rush on the college football
team, but when Aunt Matilda tells him
what to do, he says, 'Yes'm,' and does it.
One of our neighbors at home says Aunt
Matilda holds the purse-strings, but I don't
know what that means. Her purse hasn't
any strings on it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if it <i>had</i>, I'd cut 'em off,"
said Floretta, "so she <i>couldn't</i> hold
'em."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't if she lived at <i>your</i>
house," said Arabella.</p>

<p>Floretta, in spite of her boldness, was
more than half convinced.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;perhaps I wouldn't," she said.
"Why, what are you taking?"</p>

<p>"Pills," said Arabella, counting out
six very pink pills from a little bottle,
and taking them, then making a horrid
face.</p>

<p>"You don't look sick," said Floretta,
"but you're taking medicine."</p>

<p>"Aunt Matilda says these are for my
color," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You haven't any; you're pale as a
sheet," said Floretta.</p>

<p>"That's why I take them," said Arabella,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
"and look! I've got some green ones
I take," and six green pills followed the
pink ones.</p>

<p>"Why, what are those for?" gasped
Floretta. "Ought you to take two kinds
at the same time?"</p>

<p>Arabella, determined to startle her new
acquaintance, took a third bottle from her
pocket, and swallowed three very large
white pills.</p>

<p>She was delighted with the effect that she
had produced.</p>

<p>Floretta sprang to her feet, and tried to
snatch the bottle, but Arabella had put it
in her pocket, and was holding the pocket
together.</p>

<p>She narrowed her shrewd little eyes, and
smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"Guess you couldn't take all that, and
not feel queer!" she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't wonder if you felt funny.
<i>Do</i> you?" asked Floretta.</p>

<p>"Not <i>yet</i>," said Arabella.</p>

<p>Floretta was getting tired of her
caller. She hoped that she hadn't any
more kinds of medicine that she could
take.</p>

<p>She wished that Dorothy would return
and amuse Arabella.</p>

<p>She would have run away from any one
else, and rudely left her alone, but there
was something so strange about this child
that she feared her.</p>

<p>She had a nervous feeling that if she
turned to leave her, Arabella might snatch
at her, and draw her back. She certainly
did look odd.</p>

<p>There was something catlike in the way
in which she kept her eyes riveted upon
Floretta.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked as if, at any moment, she
might spring at her!</p>

<p>She was not thinking of doing anything
of the sort, however.</p>

<p>The truth was that she <i>did</i> feel just a bit
queer.</p>

<p>Was it the three kinds of pills?
She could not tell, but she began to feel
as if she would be glad if she were at
home.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go now," she said. "I
think it must be time."</p>

<p>"What time did your Aunt Matilda
tell you to come home?" Floretta
asked.</p>

<p>"She said I could stay to dinner if Dorothy
asked me, but she doesn't come home,
so I guess I won't wait."</p>

<p>"Go to dinner at the Cleverton in that
plaid gingham!" thought Floretta, for she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had seen the plain little frock beneath the
raincoat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="395" height="500" alt="She offered two cards to Floretta.&mdash;Page 210." title="" />
<span class="caption">She offered two cards to Floretta.&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_210">Page 210.</a></i></span>
</div>

<p>Arabella grasped her big umbrella firmly,
and turned, as she went down the steps, to
say:</p>

<p>"You may tell Dorothy Dainty that
<i>Miss</i> Corryville called."</p>

<p>Floretta giggled.</p>

<p>"And you might tell your Aunt Matilda
that you talked with <i>Miss</i> Paxton," she
said.</p>

<p>"I will," said Arabella, without a sign
of a smile.</p>

<p>"I wonder you don't leave cards," said
Floretta, and to her surprise, the queer
child put her hand in the pocket of her raincoat,
and, without looking at them, offered
two cards to Floretta, saying:</p>

<p>"There they are."</p>

<p>Then, without looking back, she marched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
resolutely down the road. She did not
thank Floretta for talking with her while
she rested, nor did she say "good-by."</p>

<p>For some moments Floretta stood watching
the odd little figure as it tramped down
the road, the umbrella, like a huge walking
stick, thumping the gravel at every step.
She thought Arabella would turn around,
but she did not.</p>

<p>One might have thought that she had
already forgotten the child with whom she
had been talking. When, at last, she
disappeared behind a clump of trees
that hid the curve of the road, Floretta
looked at the two cards in her hand,
stared at them in amazement, and then
laughed, laughed until her eyes were full
of tears.</p>

<p>Who could have helped laughing? One
card bore these lines:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">James Horton Worth,<br />
Painless Dentistry,<br />
10 Trevor Street, Merrivale.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>While the other, equally interesting, bore
this statement:</div>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Alton Justus Meer,<br />
Jeweller,<br />
90 Rupert Road, Merrivale.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"How perfectly funny," cried Floretta.
"I'll run up and show them to mamma, and
then I'll wait here to give them to Dorothy
and Nancy when they come. I wonder if
they'll have any choice?"</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy felt, as did the older
members of the party, that the ride had
been the most delightful of any that they
had enjoyed since their arrival.</p>

<p>The horses were tossing their manes, and
Romeo, as if in imitation, tossed his so that
it showed all its silken beauty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"See him!" cried Dorothy. "He thinks
he's as fine as any horse."</p>

<p>"Well, he is as dear as they," said
Nancy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Dorothy, "and dearer."</p>

<p>And when the horses and the pony had
been led around to the stable, and the
older members of the party had reached
the piazza, Dorothy and Nancy, who had
paused for a moment to talk, ran up the
steps, intending to sit together in a large
rocker.</p>

<p>Before they reached the chair, Floretta
flew toward them.</p>

<p>"You had a funny caller while you were
out driving," she said, with a giggle, "and
she was so very fashionable that she left
these cards. She told me to tell you that
<i>Miss</i> Corryville had called."</p>

<p>"It was Arabella," said Nancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did she truly say '<i>Miss?</i>'" Dorothy
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't I <i>say</i> so?" Floretta asked
rudely; "and I told her to tell her Aunt
Matilda that she talked with <i>Miss</i> Paxton,
and she said she would. She waited a long
time for you to come home, because she said
she meant to stay to dinner with you. Say!
She had on a calico dress! Wouldn't she
have looked gay?"</p>

<p>"It isn't very kind to laugh at any one's
clothes," said Dorothy, "and it's not very
nice to laugh at other people's friends."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried Floretta, "I shall laugh
at whoever I please," and she turned and
ran up to her room.</p>

<p>But she had laughed once too often!
During the ride, Mrs. Fenton had spoken
of Floretta's rude ways, and of the day
when, upon following Nancy to the dining-room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
she had caught the provoking child
in the act of mimicking her.</p>

<p>"Your little Nancy was grieved and distressed
because she knew that I saw it.
What a difference there is in children! The
Paxton child is disgusting, while Nancy,
who, I have heard, was a little waif, is as
gentle as Dorothy, who was born the little
daughter of a fine, old family."</p>

<p>Aunt Charlotte and Mrs. Dainty had told
Mrs. Fenton something of Nancy's life, and
noticed how deeply interested she seemed
to be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton had realized that ever since
the day that Floretta had told of being
caught mimicking Mrs. Fenton for the
amusement of the waitresses and maids,
Mrs. Fenton had shunned them. She had
made desperate efforts to win Mrs. Fenton's
friendship, but never very successfully, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
she found that her little daughter's silly
act had rendered any intimacy quite impossible.</p>

<p>A few days after the ride, Mrs. Fenton
did not appear at lunch, or at dinner, and
when Mrs. Paxton, with elaborate interest,
inquired for her, she learned that the lady
had left very early that morning, before any
guests were on the piazza to see her depart.</p>

<p>It certainly did seem odd that she should
have left, without a word to those whom
she had known, but Mrs. Dainty, with her
customary good taste, made no comment,
and Aunt Charlotte Grayson was equally
silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton did just as one might have
expected. She expressed, in a very loud
voice, her disgust at being thus pointedly
slighted, for so she chose to feel.</p>

<p>"After all my friendliness, I can't see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
how she could leave the Cleverton without
so much as a word to me. Why, I felt almost
like a relative, as my name was Fenton
before I married!"</p>

<p>"I guess Mrs. Fenton didn't have what
you might call a family feeling," said old
Mr. Cunningham, which so angered Mrs.
Paxton that she politely turned her back.</p>

<p>Two letters arrived at the Cleverton that
afternoon, and it would be difficult to say
which caused the greater surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paxton told the contents of hers to
all who would listen, and there were enough
who were curious, to make a good audience.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Mrs. Clara Fenton Paxton</span>:" it
began, refraining from any endearing
terms.</p>

<p>"I knew, before I met you, that you and
your small daughter were related to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
husband, and also knew that he entertained
no admiration for you. He left his entire
estate to me, and as you were but a distant
relative, you could expect no inheritance.
However, with a determination to deal
fairly with all my kin (I have but three
such), I came to the Cleverton to see you
and your little daughter, intending, if she
proved sweet-tempered and attractive, to
will my property to her. She is the only
one of the three relatives who bears my
husband's name.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be harsh, but I am
forced to admit that I find her to be bold,
naturally unkind, and wholly lacking in the
grace and courtesy which most children
possess, either by training or inheritance.</p>

<p>"I, therefore, have made my will in favor
of Nancy Ferris, once a little waif, now a
sweet, gentle, and attractive child, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
little acts of courtesy and kindness are fully
appreciated by</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">"Her friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Cecilia Cullen Fenton.</span>"<br />
</div>

<p>"A most singular woman, to leave her
property to a waif, a child of the theatre,
and not bequeath so much as a penny to
my Floretta, whom <i>any</i> one could see is an
aristocrat," said Mrs. Paxton.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fenton, or anybody else, would
need some rather strong glasses to see
<i>that!</i>" muttered Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>He was a testy old fellow, and he, like
other guests of the hotel, had become exceedingly
tired of Mrs. Paxton and her unlovely
child.</p>

<p>The other letter gave surprise and delight
to the two who had shared in the care and
training of little Nancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To Mrs. Rudolph Dainty, and to
Mrs. Charlotte Grayson</span>,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear friends</span>:&mdash;" was its greeting,
and then followed the story of the writer's
visit to the Cleverton, and the statement
that her few relatives were too distant to
have any valid claim to her estate.</p>

<p>"I was greatly displeased with the two
of my kin whom I came to observe, and I
will not dwell upon that, but, instead, will
take this time to say that Dorothy Dainty
and Nancy Ferris, are the two dearest children
that it has been my pleasure to know.</p>

<p>"Dorothy's life has been sunny, and
Nancy's story, as you told it to me, appealed
to me, and I looked with even greater interest
at the child who, under your loving care,
had blossomed like a lovely flower.</p>

<p>"Dorothy has her parents, and will inherit
a fortune. Nancy has no parents, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I know, will be kindly cared for by you, but
that fact will not deter me from making a
bequest that gives me greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>"I shall leave all of my estate to Nancy
Ferris, and I remind her, in some little
verses that I enclose, how deeply I have
appreciated her many little kindnesses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A SERENADE</h3>

<div class='cap'>JACK TIVERTON stood in the lower hall
one morning, and appeared as if waiting
for some one. In his hand was a short
switch that he had cut from a shrub that
grew beside the driveway. Often he looked
up the staircase, and then, as no one appeared,
he would continue to strike at the
flies that flew past the doorway.</div>

<p>At last he heard merry voices upon the
landing, and then Dorothy and Nancy came
hurrying down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" they called, but Jack,
in his eagerness to ask questions, forgot to
return their greeting.</p>

<p>"Say!" he cried, "do you know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Mrs. Paxton and Floretta left this morning
before breakfast?"</p>

<p>No, the little girls did not know that.</p>

<p>"Well, they have. I saw them go, and
I'm glad. Floretta was fun to play with,
but she wasn't fair. She'd get me to do
things, and then if we got caught, she'd always
say I planned it," said Jack.</p>

<p>Dorothy tried to think of something kind
to say of Floretta, but she knew that what
Jack said was true. Floretta truly was not
in the habit of playing "fair."</p>

<p>"Her mamma said something queer just
as she was going off. She was talking to a
lady, I don't know what her name is, and
Mrs. Paxton said:</p>

<p>"'Well, Dorothy Dainty has always
seemed to be fond of Nancy, but now that
Nancy is to have a <i>fortune</i>, shell love her
a deal more than she ever did before.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>And now Dorothy spoke, her blue eyes
flashing, and her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"That's not true!" she cried. "That's
not true! I've always loved Nancy, and always
will. I'd love her if she had just
nothing at all! Nothing could make
any difference. I love her all I can.
Nancy knows that. Every one knows
that."</p>

<p>How keenly she felt Mrs. Paxton's silly
speech!</p>

<p>She was indignant that any one should
think her love for Nancy so little worth
while that fortune could make it stronger.</p>

<p>How could she love Nancy more than she
had always loved her?</p>

<p>Nancy threw her arms about her, and
drew her closer.</p>

<p>"Don't you mind, Dorothy," she said,
"<i>I</i> know how truly you love me. Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Paxton didn't know, because I guess she
couldn't understand it. <i>She</i> couldn't love
the way you do."</p>

<p>Dorothy smiled through the tears that
had filled her eyes.</p>

<p>"There's no one dearer than you,
Nancy," she said.</p>

<p>Jack swung his switch at a dragon-fly
that flew past the doorway.</p>

<p>"Did you see that darning-needle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, without waiting
for an answer, "I was down the road a few
days ago, trying to catch some of those big
steel-colored ones in my fly-net. I hadn't
seen any one after I left this piazza, but
just as I swung my net round to catch the
dragon-fly, somebody said: 'Look out, or
you'll get bitten!' and I turned round, but
no one was in sight. I was just going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
swing my net again, when some one giggled,
and then I saw a little skinny girl looking
at me from between some bushes."</p>

<p>"What was she doing?" Dorothy asked.</p>

<p>"You couldn't guess if you tried for a
month!" said Jack.</p>

<p>"She was sitting on a big stone, beside
a big puddle that was left there after the
shower. She said she was playing she was
a frog, and when she stared at me through
her glasses, and smiled, no, <i>grinned</i> at me,
I couldn't help thinking she looked like one.
Say, she had on a green cloak, a regular
frog-color."</p>

<p>"It must have been <i>Arabella!</i>" said
Nancy.</p>

<p>"I don't know what her name was. I
didn't ask her, but while I watched her
she hopped off the stone into the puddle
with both feet, and cried, 'po-dunk!' just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
like an old bullfrog. My! Weren't her
shoes wet!"</p>

<p>"I wonder what her Aunt Matilda said
when she went home with wet feet," said
Dorothy.</p>

<p>Without noticing what she said, Jack continued.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a queer girl!" he said,
in disgust, "for when I told her dragonflies
would never bite, she said: 'They will.
They'll sew your eyes, and nose, and mouth
up. Po-dunk!' and she hopped back on to
the stone, and grinned at me just as she did
at first. Say! She made me feel queer to
look at her, and I turned and ran away. I
wasn't afraid of her, of course, but she <i>did</i>
make me feel queer!"</p>

<p>"She'd make any one feel queer," said
Nancy as they turned toward the dining-room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack wished that they might have stayed
longer in the hall. He had intended to ask
them if they knew Arabella, and if she was
always doing queer things, but Mrs. Dainty
and Aunt Charlotte joined them, and they
went in for breakfast.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiverton, coming in from an early
walk, took Jack with her to the other side
of the dining-room. He looked across at
them, and wondered what they could have
told of Arabella if they had had a chance.
He decided to question them, whispering
softly to himself:</p>

<p>"I'll <i>make</i> them tell me all they know
about that funny girl."</p>

<p>For several days he tried to catch Dorothy
or Nancy at a time when he could question
them.</p>

<p>He chased Dorothy up the long stairway
one morning, only to see her disappear into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
her room. He had not told her that he had
wished to talk with her, and she, believing
that he was only chasing her for fun, ran
from him, laughing as she went.</p>

<p>He found Nancy, a few minutes later,
and coaxed her to wait on the landing.</p>

<p>"Now, Nancy," he said, "you've got to
tell me something about that queer girl
that you and Dorothy know."</p>

<p>"If you mean Arabella," said Nancy,
"I don't see what I could tell you, only
that she <i>is</i> queer, and you know that
now."</p>

<p>"You'll better believe I know it!" cried
Jack, "for I met her again yesterday, and
guess what she was doing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't," said Nancy. "No one
ever could guess what Arabella Corryville
would do."</p>

<p>"Well, she looked like a witch, and acted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
like one, too," Jack replied. "It was yesterday
that I saw her. I was going across
the field, and had nearly reached the wall,
when I looked up, and saw her sitting on
the top bar of the&mdash;the&mdash;oh, the place
where they take down the bars to let the
cattle through."</p>

<p>"I know where you mean," said Nancy,
"but why was it strange that she was sitting
there?"</p>

<p>"It was what she was doing that was
funny," Jack replied, "and because you
couldn't guess, I'll tell you.</p>

<p>"She didn't look toward me, though I'm
sure she must have heard me coming, for
I was just tramping along, and whistling
all the way. She was looking up at the
clouds, and counting, 'one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;'
very slowly, and when I was close behind
her, she said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh! I'm charming the
crows!'</p>

<p>"'How long does it take to do it?' I
said, for it sounded like nonsense, and I
wanted to hurry. It was almost lunch time.</p>

<p>"'Hush&mdash;sh!' she said again. 'There
comes one of them now!' and sure enough
a big, black crow did come flying right
down, and perched on the limb of an old
tree near her."</p>

<p>"Why, Jack Tiverton," cried Nancy,
"you don't believe Arabella really <i>made</i>
him come down, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," cried Jack, "but she
wanted me to think so. Say! She said she
was saying a charm, and when I asked her
what it was, she wouldn't tell me. She said
it would spoil the charm to tell it. She
looked funny sitting up there on the top
rail, and staring at the crows till her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
watered. She didn't look like a 'charmer.'
She looked ever so much more like a scarecrow!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, it's horrid to say that!"
cried Nancy, at the same time trying not to
let him see how near she was to laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, she <i>did!</i>" Jack insisted, "and
you're almost laughing now, Nancy Ferris,
and you'd have screamed if you'd seen
her roosting there, and calling herself a
charmer! Why, that old crow just flopped
down there for fun, and when he saw the
queer-looking girl, he cawed as if it made
him mad, and I didn't blame him. Say!
She had a shoe on one foot, and a slipper
on the other. Her apron was put on back-side-to,
and she had a hen's feather in each
hand, and she waved them up and down
while she mumbled some kind of a verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
She said her clothes were put on that way
to help the charm. Isn't she a <i>ninny?</i>"</p>

<p>Just at that moment, before Nancy could
reply, Mrs. Tiverton called Jack, and Nancy
ran to tell the story of Arabella's latest
freak to Dorothy.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One afternoon, a number of little girls
were sitting on the piazza at the Cleverton,
and their merry voices attracted Jack Tiverton,
who glanced up from the book that
he was reading, and then, because he
was curious to know what so interested
them, crossed the piazza, and joined the
group.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Nancy, in the big hammock,
held the book of fairy tales, Flossie Barnet
sat near them, while the others, all little
guests at the hotel, sat upon the railing, or
in the large rockers that stood near.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack joined the row perched upon the
railing.</p>

<p>"Tell a fellow what you are all talking
about, will you? Will you, <i>please</i>, I
mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dorothy Dainty has been reading us a
lovely story," said a little girl, whose merry
eyes showed that she had enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"What's it about?" Jack asked, and
then, "Oh, <i>fairy</i> tales!" he said.</p>

<p>"Don't you like fairy tales?" Flossie
questioned, looking up at him.</p>

<p>No one liked to differ with dear little
Flossie, least of all, Jack Tiverton.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like them <i>some</i>," he said, awkwardly,
"but,&mdash;are there any stories about
bandits or pirates in that book?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," they cried, in a laughing
chorus, "and there aren't any wild Indians
in it, either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care much about Indian stories,"
Jack replied, "but I do like to read
about pirates."</p>

<p>"But just hear what this one was
about," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"The wandering prince had, for years,
been searching for a lovely princess, who
should look like a beautiful picture that
hung in his father's palace. One day he
came to a castle where the people told him
a handsome princess was imprisoned, and
he asked why she was kept there. They
told him that she was enchanted, and that
some day, a wandering prince would sing
beneath her window, and then the
spell would be broken, and she would be
free."</p>

<p>Jack was interested.</p>

<p>"But s'posing he couldn't sing?" he
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, a prince could surely sing!" said
Flossie.</p>

<p>"And p'raps he could sing under her
window, if he couldn't anywhere else,"
ventured a dreamy-eyed little girl who sat
near Dorothy.</p>

<p>"And how would he know <i>what</i> to
sing?" a cheery voice questioned, and a
pair of merry eyes peered over the piazza
railing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harry!" cried Flossie,
"what difference would it make?"</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world," declared
Uncle Harry, "for while the proper
melody would set the princess free, how are
we to know that the wrong melody might
not chain her closer than before!"</p>

<p>"Why, the story doesn't say that," said
Nancy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but the prince took an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<i>awful</i> risk when he chose what to sing,"
declared Uncle Harry.</p>

<p>"You're laughing when you say it,"
said Dorothy.</p>

<p>"He is," agreed Flossie, "and what he
says is funny, but I know this: I'd love to
hear some one singing under <i>my</i> window!"</p>

<p>Some ladies, who sat near enough to hear
the conversation, were amused at the children's
enthusiasm, and at Uncle Harry's
evident interest.</p>

<p>"The prince had his guitar slung over
his shoulder by a ribbon," said Dorothy.
"See the picture," and she slipped from
the hammock, and offered the book that he
might see the illustration.</p>

<p>"I'm glad he carried his guitar instead
of a banjo," he said.</p>

<p>"Why are you glad of that?" Flossie
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, because I really <i>am</i>, in fact, I might
even say I am delighted," he replied.</p>

<p>"I do believe he intends to serenade
those children," said a handsome woman,
to her friend who sat beside her; "he is a
brilliant man, and one who is blessed with
many talents, and one of his greatest
charms is his love of children. He will go
far out of his way to afford them a bit of
fun."</p>

<p>That evening, when nearly every one had
left the piazza, and all of the children were
in their rooms, the soft twanging of guitar
strings floated up toward Flossie's window.</p>

<p>She was not yet asleep, and she sat up in
bed, and listened.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a guitar! Was it Uncle
Harry's?</p>

<p>A little prelude softly played, drew her
toward the window.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>She crept closer, and peeped out. Yes,
there he was, looking right up toward her
window.</p>

<p>Now his fine voice was softly singing,
and Flossie held her breath.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Under thy window, my little lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Under thy window, Flossie dear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Here where the moonbeams softly flicker,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sing I this song that you may hear.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You shall be happy little lady,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Give me your love for the song I sing."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Harry, you have it <i>now!</i>"
cried Flossie. "I love you, when you're
singing, and <i>all</i> the time."</p>

<p>"I know that, dear little girl, but I <i>must</i>
have my fun, so I came here to sing the song
I made for you," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Well, you're <i>dear</i>," she cried, "and I'll
throw you a kiss," and she did, reaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
far out of the window that he might surely
see her.</p>

<p>"I caught it!" he cried, and as he
turned toward the porch, she heard
him softly strumming the prelude
again.</p>

<p>Others had heard the pretty song, for
Dorothy and Nancy had a room next to
Flossie's.</p>

<p>The next morning he was coaxed and
teased to sing the song again, but he declared
that he could only sing it in the
moonlight, that the daylight would spoil its
effect.</p>

<p>The sunny days sped on wings, and soon
the guests began to think of turning homeward.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dainty's party and the Barnets
were to leave the hotel at the same time,
and Dorothy, Nancy, and Flossie were delighted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
that they were to take the return
trip together.</p>

<p>They were talking of the pleasures that
they were looking forward to, and telling of
some delightful events that were already
planned, when Jack Tiverton gave them a
genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"Mamma has just told me something
fine," he said, "and I ran right down to tell
it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell it quick!" said Flossie.</p>

<p>"We're going to live in Merrivale,
and we'll be there soon after we leave
here. I'm glad. Are you, <i>all</i> of you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course we're glad," said Dorothy
and Nancy; and Flossie hastened to
add:</p>

<p>"Every one of us is glad."</p>

<p>There were bright days, and many pleasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in store for the little friends, and those
who would like also to enjoy them, and to
know what happened during the winter,

while abundant life is supplied by the
doings of merry friends, and there is rich

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
